# Classic UI (`net.sf.freecol.client.gui.classic`)

A primitive, original-1994-*Colonization*-style view for FreeCol, built as an
alternative `GUI` implementation on top of the unchanged engine. This document
is the **implementation reference** for the code in this package — the durable
"how it works / why" that outlives the phase-by-phase tracker in the repo-root
[`CLASSIC_UI_PLAN.md`](../../../../../../../CLASSIC_UI_PLAN.md) (which tracks
*remaining* work and the broader asset/rules tracks).

## What this is & how it is selected

FreeCol is cleanly layered: `common/model` (UI-agnostic game state), the
`client/control/*` controllers (reach the view only via `getGUI().<method>`),
and the view facade `client/gui/GUI.java` — a **concrete base class with no
abstract methods and no-op stubs** (used as-is in headless mode). A new UI is
therefore just another `GUI` subclass: unoverridden methods no-op, so the app
runs from day one and screens light up incrementally.

Selection point, `client/FreeColClient.java`:
```java
gui = headless ? new GUI(this) : classic ? new ClassicGUI(this) : new SwingGUI(this);
```
The `--classic` command-line flag picks `ClassicGUI`. The change to upstream is
purely additive: this package + a one-line selector change + the flag, so the
fork stays mergeable with `master`.

Run it (from the repo root, so `data/` is found):
```powershell
ant compile
java -Xmx2G -cp "build;jars/*" net.sf.freecol.FreeCol --classic --fast --no-intro
```
`--fast --no-intro` auto-starts a single-player game with no GUI clicks — the
fastest way to the in-game view. It starts at sea: the ship on an ocean patch.

## `ClassicGUI` — the view facade

`ClassicGUI extends GUI` and overrides only the methods it implements:

- **Lifecycle.** `startGUI` shows the main `JFrame` (title-screen background is
  the original `OPENING.PIK`, painted via the FreeCol key
  `image.background.MainPanel` when the `classic_original` asset pack is loaded;
  otherwise base art). `reconnectGUI(active, tile)` — the game-start hook fired
  by `FreeColClient.restoreGUI` — builds the Phase-2 HUD: a `BorderLayout`
  content pane with the `ClassicMapViewer` in the centre, the `ClassicInfoPanel`
  on the right (`EAST`), and the reused `InGameMenuBar` as the frame's menu bar;
  then seeds the initial view state/focus. `quitGUI` disposes the frame. See
  "Phase 2 HUD" below.
- **`installLookAndFeel(fontName)`.** The base `GUI` no-ops this, leaving
  `FontLibrary`'s main font null — which NPEs once the reused `InGameMenuBar`
  paints its golden gold/tax/year status line via `FontLibrary.getMainFont()`.
  So the classic GUI overrides it to create the main font (and set the
  image-border scale factor so the menu bar's wood border renders; and installs
  the menu-dropdown `UIManager` defaults — see "Menu dropdowns" below). It
  deliberately does **not** install `FreeColLookAndFeel`: that L&F swaps in a
  `PanelUI` that paints the parchment texture behind every `JPanel`, which would
  override the classic map's black fog and the dark info panel. The menu bar
  paints its own parchment background + wood border regardless of the L&F, so the
  top bar still reads classic; the dropdown popups get their own wood/green
  reskin instead, targeted narrowly enough not to need the full L&F.
- **Pre-game lobby stopgap.** There is no classic lobby yet, so
  `showStartGamePanel` auto-launches single-player games (`player.setReady(true)`
  + `requestLaunch`); otherwise a new game stalls at login because the base
  `GUI` no-ops the lobby. Multiplayer no-ops.
- **View-state delegation.** `changeView(Tile|Unit|)`, `getViewMode`,
  `getActiveUnit`, `getSelectedTile`, `getFocus`/`setFocus`,
  `refresh`/`refreshTile` all delegate to the `ClassicMapViewer`, which *owns*
  the classic view state. `refresh`/`refreshTile` also call
  `invalidateMinimap()` (they are the model-change hooks).
- **Image libraries.** `getFixedImageLibrary`/`getScaledImageLibrary` must be
  non-null even at scaffold stage: `ActionManager` builds every `FreeColAction`
  regardless of the active view and several look up order-button icons from
  their constructors. One unscaled `ImageLibrary` serves both today.
- **`showColonyPanel` — the classic colony screen.** A click on an owned colony
  (and the automatic open when one is founded) shows the `ClassicColonyPanel` in a
  window of its own (the classic UI has no `Canvas` to host panels in). Only one
  colony screen is open at a time — opening another disposes the previous — and
  the whole thing is guarded so a failure degrades to a log line. See "Colony
  screen" below.
- **Dialog seams (`modalConfirmDialog` / `modalChoiceDialog` / `getNewColonyName`).**
  The classic dialogs are Phase 3, but three controller flows can't proceed
  without an answer, so these are wired now with plain (unstyled) Swing dialogs:
  `modalConfirmDialog` (e.g. the build-colony site warnings), `modalChoiceDialog`
  (e.g. which unit(s) to disembark from a laden ship) and `getNewColonyName`
  (which returns FreeCol's suggested name, made unique, rather than prompting —
  the base `modalInputDialog` still no-ops). Without these, founding a colony —
  and hence the colony screen — would be unreachable. All run their dialog on the
  event thread via `onEventThread` (controllers call from arbitrary threads).
  Phase 3 reskins them.

## `ClassicMapViewer` — the map

A `JPanel` that renders the map on a **plain rectangular grid** (where
`SwingGUI`'s `MapViewer` paints isometric diamonds) centred on a focus tile,
mirroring the original game. It owns the view state
(`viewMode`/`focus`/`selectedTile`/`activeUnit`) and holds a back-reference to
`ClassicGUI` so clicks/keys route through the `GUI`/controller path exactly as
`SwingGUI.clickAt`/`MoveAction` do.

**Projection** (square 48px cells = native 16px × `CLASSIC_SCALE` 3):
```
screenX = width/2  + (tileX - focusX) * TILE_W - TILE_W/2
screenY = height/2 + (tileY - focusY) * TILE_H - TILE_H/2
```
`tileAt(px,py)` is the inverse (via `Math.floorDiv`).

**Terrain rendering.** The original rectangular `TERRAIN.SS` tiles fill the grid
cleanly (no diamond gaps). Tiles are fetched at native 16×16 via
`ImageLibrary.getTerrainImage(type, x, y, SRC_SIZE)` and up-scaled
nearest-neighbour (`VALUE_INTERPOLATION_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR`) so the chunky classic
pixels stay crisp. Unexplored tiles are left black (classic fog). The
key→frame mapping lives in `tools/classic_assets/aliases.properties`. When the
asset pack is absent the same keys fall back to FreeCol's own (isometric) art.

**Unit & goods sprites.** The original *Colonization* unit map-sprites and goods
icons come from `ICONS.SS`, aliased onto FreeCol's own resource keys in the same
`aliases.properties` (all 194 `image.unit.model.unit.*` base+role keys and 22
`image.icon.model.goods.*` keys). Because Col1 draws every civilian colonist with
one generic map sprite and one sprite per *role*, the aliases collapse to a small
set of frames: a base colonist for all civilian types, shared soldier / dragoon /
scout / pioneer / missionary role sprites, one frame per ship, and wagon /
artillery / treasure / brave / regular. The full frame table is documented in the
"Units & goods" block of `aliases.properties`. Goods icons only surface on the
Phase-2 colony/Europe screens; the unit sprites render on the map immediately.

**`drawCentered` — cell-fit for both art styles.** `paintTile` draws the
settlement/unit sprite through `drawCentered`, which sizes it to the cell
(preserving aspect) by branching on source size — which doubles as pack
detection. The original `ICONS.SS` sprites are ~16px, so they fit *inside* the
48px cell and are **up-scaled** to `UNIT_CELL_FRACTION` (0.9) of it,
nearest-neighbour like the terrain (else a 16px unit renders tiny). FreeCol's own
pack-absent art is sized for its 128×64 tiles, larger than the cell, and is
**shrunk** to fit as before. `paintTile` draws the settlement sprite the same way,
through `getScaledSettlementImage` (native ~16px, so the up-scale branch fires),
mirroring `getScaledUnitImage` — *not* `getSettlementImage(…, TILE_SIZE)`, which
would pre-size to 128×64 and bypass the crisp branch. Per-nation unit/colony
tinting and a fortress-distinct colony frame are documented follow-ups in
`CLASSIC_UI_PLAN.md`.

**Settlement sprites.** Colony and native-settlement map-sprites are aliased onto
FreeCol's `image.tileitem.model.settlement.*` keys in the same `aliases.properties`
(the "Settlements" block). Native settlements key off the settlement-type id
(`camp`/`village`/`inca`/`aztec` = `ICONS.SS` `010`/`011`/`012`/`013`). Colonies are
subtler: `ImageLibrary.getSettlementKey` builds `…colony.<size>[.stockade|.fort|
.fortress]` and then *prefers a per-nation key when one exists* — and the base pack
defines one for every European nation — so a neutral `…colony.small` alias would
never be reached. The block therefore overrides all 8 nation suffixes directly,
folding Col1's real signal (fortification) onto FreeCol's size×stockade grid:
unfortified `003`(small)→`000`(medium/large), stockade `001`, fort/fortress the
stone `002`. See the "Settlements" block of `aliases.properties` for the full table.

**Edge scrolling.** A mouse-motion listener sets an edge direction when the
cursor enters a ~1-tile hot zone at any window edge/corner; a repeating `Timer`
pans the focus by a **raw** rectangular-grid step while the mouse stays there
(stopped on `mouseExited`). Raw `(x,y)` steps, *not* `Direction.step` — the
isometric N/S step jumps two raw rows. Suppressed while the mouse is over the
minimap box.

**Controller wiring (clicks & keys drive the real `InGameController`).**

- **Click** ports `SwingGUI.clickAt`: unexplored → `setFocus`; owned colony →
  `showColonyPanel`; owned unit → `changeView(unit,false)` (make active);
  foreign unit/settlement → `setFocus`; empty explored tile → `changeView(tile)`
  (TERRAIN-select). A single click already terrain-selects (the rectangular grid
  has no drag-vs-click ambiguity), which also arms the TERRAIN cursor keys.
  Minimap-region clicks are intercepted *before* this (see below).
- **Keys** mirror `MoveAction`: arrow / numpad 8-2-4-6 orthogonal, numpad
  7-9-1-3 & Home/PageUp/End/PageDown diagonal, bound `WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW`.
  MOVE_UNITS → `InGameController.moveUnit(activeUnit, dir)`; TERRAIN → step the
  selected-tile cursor to `getNeighbourOrNull(dir)`; nothing selected (END_TURN)
  → raw-grid free pan so the map stays navigable. After a unit move the focus
  follows the unit.
- **⚠️ Isometric-vs-rectangular caveat (resolved).** Model `Direction` is
  isometric (`Direction.N` steps two raw rows), but this viewer draws a raw grid.
  The four orthogonal keys therefore resolve — parity-aware, via
  `Map.getDirection` — to the `Direction` whose *raw* step lands on the visually
  adjacent cell (e.g. straight-up is `NE` on even rows, `NW` on odd), so
  on-screen movement matches the key. The four diagonal keys map to the
  isometric corner directions, whose raw offset shifts with row parity — an
  inherent flattening artefact, documented on `intentToDirection`.
- **Turn controls (classic-*Colonization* key scheme).** Because there is no menu
  bar / `Canvas` to install FreeCol's own accelerators, the viewer binds the
  turn-control keys directly (`WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW`, like the movement keys),
  driving the real `InGameController`. Keys follow the original 1994 game (from its
  manual — see `bindTurnControls`):
  - **Enter** → `endTurn(false)` — end the turn. `false` because the classic `GUI`
    no-ops modal dialogs, so `endTurn(true)`'s "units still active" confirm would
    misbehave. Verified live: the turn advances (AI players process, a new turn
    begins) and the map/minimap refresh.
  - **Space** → "no orders": skip the active unit for this turn, mirroring
    `SkipUnitAction` (`changeState(unit, SKIPPED)` then `nextActiveUnit()`). With no
    active unit, Space ends the turn instead (as in the original, where Space
    advances the turn once every unit is done).
  - **W** → wait: `InGameController.waitUnit()` — cycle to the other units needing
    orders and return to this one.
  - **B** → build colony: `InGameController.buildColony(activeUnit)`, mirroring
    `BuildColonyAction` (the original manual: "To build a colony, press the build
    key (B)"). Guarded by the same precondition as the action's `shouldBeEnabled`
    (`hasTile() && canBuildColony()`), so pressing B with a ship or a spent unit
    selected quietly does nothing. The controller does the rest — it confirms any
    site warnings (`modalConfirmDialog`), names the colony (`getNewColonyName`) and
    on success opens the colony screen. This is the only way to reach the colony
    screen live, since `--fast` starts at sea; the flow is **sail to land →
    disembark a colonist → press B**.
- **Next-active-unit at turn start (caveat).** After `endTurn`, whether a fresh
  active unit is auto-selected is up to the controller's `setCurrentPlayer` →
  `updateActiveUnit` → `changeView(unit)` path, which the classic `GUI` already
  delegates to `changeToMoveUnits` (so it *does* re-centre on the next active unit
  when `player.hasNextActiveUnit()`). Movement was verified live post-end-turn
  (the active ship moves and the focus follows it); note that panning the focus
  away (e.g. a minimap click) leaves the active unit's cursor off-screen until a
  movement key re-centres on it.

**Minimap raster.** A whole-map overview: a plain rectangular
`map.getWidth() × map.getHeight()` raster — **no** isometric projection (unlike
`client/gui/panel/MiniMap`, which is the colour-source reference only). The map
viewer *builds and caches* it (it is map data); it is **drawn by
`ClassicInfoPanel`**, which hosts the minimap at the top of the right column as
the original does. (It began as a bottom-left overlay on the map itself; the
"HUD minimap" slice moved it into the info panel — see "Phase 2 HUD" below.)

- Colours: unexplored → `ImageLibrary.getMinimapBackgroundColor()`; explored →
  `getMinimapPoliticsColor(tile.getType())`; a tile with a settlement/unit →
  the owner's `getNationColor()`. All guarded with fallbacks (`orElse`).
- Sizing: integer pixels-per-tile `max(1, MINIMAP_MAX/max(w,h))` fits the raster
  into a ~200px box, so a tall/narrow map renders as a vertical strip.
- **Caching / performance:** the raster is cached in a `BufferedImage` and
  rebuilt only when `invalidateMinimap()` marks it dirty — wired to
  `ClassicGUI.refresh`/`refreshTile`, the model-change hooks (exploration, new
  settlements, unit moves). `getMinimapImage()` returns the cache, rebuilding if
  stale; the panel blits it every repaint, so no per-repaint tile iteration.
- **Accessors for the panel:** `getMinimapImage()`, `getMinimapPixelsPerTile()`,
  `getViewHalfCols()`/`getViewHalfRows()` (the visible tile span, for the panel's
  viewport box) and `recenterOnTile(x,y)` (a minimap click → `setFocus`). The old
  in-viewer `paintMinimap`/`minimapClick`/`minimapBounds` and the edge-scroll
  suppression over the overlay box were removed with the move.

**Feature overlays (item (e)).** On top of the base terrain, `paintTile`
composites the per-tile *physical features* — forest trees, hills, mountains,
rivers, roads, plowed fields, resource markers and the lost-city rumour — via
`ClassicTileArt`, before the settlement/unit sprite. This is the last
map-fidelity slice, and its crux was **asset shape, not code**:

- **The overlays live in `PHYS0.SS`, not `TERRAIN.SS`.** `TERRAIN.SS` holds
  only the 12 base terrains; the original game drew a cell as a base tile plus
  square 16×16 *overlay* sprites, and those are a separate 154-frame set,
  `PHYS0.SS`. Being square (like the base tiles), they composite onto the
  classic rectangular cells with **no skew** — which is exactly why FreeCol's
  own isometric-diamond overlay art could not be reused here.
- **Frame map** (verified by pixel edge-analysis of the extracted frames, see
  the `ClassicTileArt` class comment for the table): all the *directional*
  feature sets share one 4-bit connectivity encoding — the frame within a set is
  `(E?1) | (W?2) | (S?4) | (N?8)` over the neighbours that also carry the
  feature — with bases minor-river `0`, major-river `16`, mountains `32`,
  hills `48`, forest `64`. Roads are composited instead: frame `80` is the
  centre hub and `81..88` the eight directional spokes (N…NW clockwise), one
  drawn per neighbour with a road. `103` is the lost-city rumour, `149` the
  plowed field, `89..102` the resource markers (a provisional read pending the
  expert's validation).
- **Connectivity is over *raw-grid* neighbours** (the cells drawn directly
  up/down/left/right and at the corners), not FreeCol's isometric
  `Direction`s, so a feature blends with whatever is *visually* adjacent on the
  square grid. Area features (forest / hills / mountains) use the four cardinal
  neighbours. Rivers are linear and FreeCol lays them along the isometric
  long-sides — which flatten to raw *diagonals* — so each diagonal neighbour
  with a river folds into its two adjacent cardinal bits, keeping a
  diagonally-running river visually connected. Roads draw a spoke toward each of
  the eight raw neighbours that has a road.
- **Loading & fallback.** The frames are exposed by the `classic_original` pack
  under the keys `image.classic_original.ss.PHYS0.SS.NNN` and loaded straight by
  key (cached), so no new alias entries are needed. When the pack is absent
  (`packPresent` false) `ClassicTileArt` falls back to FreeCol's own
  `getForestImage` / `getSizedOverlayImage` / `getRiverImage` — imperfect
  (isometric-shaped) on the square grid but enough to keep the build running.
- **Live-verification note.** Forest compositing was confirmed live by sailing
  the start ship to a coast (`--fast` starts at sea, so land must be reached to
  see overlays). Rivers/hills/mountains/roads share the *identical* draw path
  and 16×16 square sprites, so they render the same way; the classic UI's
  reconnect stopgap makes FreeCol's debug "reveal map" ineffective (it resyncs
  via a reconnect the classic UI does not fully reload), so inland features are
  reached by sailing rather than revealed.

**Coastline (beach feathering).** On top of the base ocean, `paintOverlays`
also feathers the land/water border for every **water** cell (`!tile.isLand()`)
with the original `PHYS0.SS` coast quarter-tiles, so borders blend like Col1
instead of showing a hard edge. The crux was again asset RE:

- **32 8×8 quarter-tiles, frames `108..139`** — `4 corners × 8 configs` laid out
  `frame = 108 + config*4 + corner`, corner clockwise `NW=0, NE=1, SE=2, SW=3`.
  One sub-tile is drawn per cell quadrant; for a given corner the two orthogonal
  neighbours bounding it and the diagonal neighbour select the config:
  `config = (ccwEdgeLand?1) | (diagLand?2) | (cwEdgeLand?4)` (verified
  rotationally consistent across all four corners — config 1 = the
  counter-clockwise edge neighbour is land, 4 = the clockwise edge, 2 = a
  diagonal-only neighbour draws a light coastal-water wedge, 0 = open ocean draws
  nothing). The per-corner neighbour offsets live in `COAST_CORNERS`.
- **Two decode quirks masked the scheme in earlier recon:** (i) these frames
  encode transparency as **opaque black** (a colour-key, index 0) rather than the
  `0xFD` alpha the other sets use — so `108..111` ("empty") are config 0; (ii)
  `116..119`'s "water but no land" are config 2, the diagonal-only coastal-water
  wedges. The decoder leaves that colour-key black **opaque**, so
  `ClassicTileArt.frame` keys pure black out to alpha 0 when it loads a coast
  frame (`keyOutBlack`, cached) — otherwise plain `drawImage` would paint the
  black regions as opaque wedges over the sea along every coastline. With the
  black keyed out the base ocean shows through and `paintCoast` just draws the
  8×8 sub-tile into its quadrant.
- **Not yet wired:** the estuary/river-mouth pieces — `140..147` (ocean
  corner-hints) and `150..153` (diagonal sand strips). Deferred (river mouths).

**Land/land tile borders — dithered edge-blend (Q7, fixed 2026-08-05).** `paintCoast`
only ever ran for water cells; two adjacent **land** tiles of different `TileType` got
no feathering at all, so a bare (non-forest/hill) tile like Prairie rendered as a
perfectly flat, hard-edged 48px rectangle against its neighbours — see
`screenshots/ui-square-tiles-bug.png` for the original live capture (four adjacent
tiles, each a flat unblended square) versus any original reference shot (e.g.
`screenshots/initial/opening_007.png`), which never showed this. Live-clicking through
`--classic` confirmed the root cause: a "Prärie" tile (zero overlay) sat next to a
"Mischwald" tile whose substituted base texture
(`image.tile.model.tile.mixedForest.center` → `TERRAIN.SS.002`, plains) is visually
near-identical to Prairie's own (`TERRAIN.SS.003`) — so what read as one large
hard-edged block was actually two different `TileType`s with no blending between
them, not a forest-connectivity issue.

No dedicated land-land border/transition sprite sheet exists to source (every
extracted `.SS` archive under `tools/classic_assets` output was checked — `TERRAIN.SS`
is 12 base frames only, `PHYS0.SS` covers forest/hills/mountains/rivers/roads/
resources/coast and nothing else), so the fix is procedural rather than a sprite
lookup: `ClassicMapViewer.blendLandBorders`, called from `paintTile` right after the
base terrain is fetched and before `ClassicTileArt.paintOverlays` composites the
feature layer, checks each raw-grid cardinal neighbour for land of a *different*
`TileType` and, where true, replaces a `BORDER_BAND`-pixel-wide band along that edge
(in native 16×16 sprite space, before the ×3 `CLASSIC_SCALE` up-scale) with the
mirrored pixel from the neighbour's own base texture. **Which pixels blend is
noise-selected, not an ordered dither:** the first cut used a 2×2 Bayer matrix, but
side-by-side comparison against the expert's reference shots showed the original's
land borders as sparse, uneven speckling — a small repeating matrix instead read as
a visibly regular checkerboard band, denser and more uniform than the reference.
`ditherEdge` now gates each candidate pixel on `hashNoise` (a cheap integer hash of
its *world* pixel coordinate, so the scatter is stable across repaints — no flicker —
without repeating tile-to-tile like the matrix did) against `BORDER_DENSITY`
(`0.45`, tapering to 0 over `BORDER_BAND` rows), roughly halving the blended-pixel
count versus the matrix version and breaking up the regular grid look. Only a land
tile's own cached terrain image copy is touched (`copyImage`); `paintCoast` and the
overlay compositing are untouched.

**Extended to the land side of coastlines too.** The expert also flagged that a
coastline still looked wrong even after the above: `paintCoast`'s quarter-tiles
feather the *water* tile with a fixed beach/foam sprite regardless of which land
type it borders, but the **land** tile's own edge got no treatment at all (it was
explicitly excluded — `blendLandBorders` originally required the neighbour to be
land), so it still ended in a hard square against the water. `blendLandBorders` now
blends against *any* differently-typed neighbour, water included, so the land tile's
edge also softens toward the water's colour — complementary to, not a replacement
for, `paintCoast`'s existing water-side feathering.

That surfaced a real, previously-latent bug: `ditherEdge` indexed the neighbour
image using the *tile's own* width/height, silently assuming every neighbour sprite
comes back the size requested. `ImageLibrary.getTerrainImage` only honours that
request when the source sprite's aspect ratio already matches it —
`ImageUtils.wildcardDimension` otherwise preserves the *source's* aspect ratio to
avoid distorting it — which every square `TERRAIN.SS` land frame happens to satisfy,
but water's source art does not, so a water neighbour's returned image is a
different (non-16×16) shape. Reading it with the land tile's own indices threw
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` on every repaint once a land tile was next to
water (i.e. immediately, on any coastal tile) — caught by
`FreeColClient`'s uncaught-exception handler, so the process didn't crash outright,
but the map view never advanced past its "waiting for the game" placeholder text.
Caught live (`FreeCol.log`), not by inspection. Fixed by having `ditherEdge` read
`neighbour`'s own width/height: the along-edge axis is scaled proportionally into
the neighbour's span and the depth axis clamped into it, so a differently-shaped
neighbour degrades to a coarser sample instead of an out-of-bounds read.

Verified live against `screenshots/ui-square-tiles-fixed.png`/`-crop.png`/`-coast.png`
at the same map location as the original bug capture, with coastline feathering,
forest/hill overlays and the composited tree canopy all rendering unchanged on top
of the blended base, and 0 uncaught exceptions in `FreeCol.log` for the session. See
[land-tile-borders.md](../../../../../../../classic_ui_plan/land-tile-borders.md) for
the original bug writeup and
[Q7, Resolved](../../../../../../../classic_ui_plan/ui-phases.md#open-questions-for-the-expert).

## Phase 2 HUD (menu bar + info/orders panel)

The map view no longer fills the whole frame. `ClassicGUI.reconnectGUI` composes
the classic map screen: the `ClassicMapViewer` in the centre, a `ClassicInfoPanel`
strip on the right, and a menu bar on top. This is the **first Phase-2 slice**,
driven by the expert's original-game screenshots (local `screenshots/`, git-
excluded); it is functional, not yet pixel-faithful chrome.

- **Menu bar — reused `InGameMenuBar`.** Rather than build a classic menu bar, the
  frame uses FreeCol's own `InGameMenuBar` (the sanctioned "reuse `action/`"
  path): five menus (Game / View / Orders / Report / Colopedia) already wired to
  the real `FreeColAction`s, plus a golden gold/tax/score/year status line it
  paints itself. Building the bar only looks up pre-built actions, so it is safe.
  In the user's locale the menus render localized (German in the expert's shots).
- **Menu-bar contrast — `ClassicGUI.styleClassicMenuBar`.** The original's bar is a
  **dark strip with light labels** (design ref: `opening_008`); FreeCol's reused bar
  is dark-on-parchment, which read as nearly illegible in our HUD. The hook is
  `FreeColMenuBar.paintComponent`, which tiles its parchment background **only while
  the bar is non-opaque** and otherwise defers to `super.paintComponent` — so making
  the bar **opaque with a dark background** swaps the parchment for Col1's dark
  strip, and the menu labels are then re-coloured light. The bar's own golden status
  line already reads on dark (`InGameMenuBar.paintComponent` draws it *after* the
  background), and the wood border is kept — it still reads classic.
  - Safe **after construction**: `InGameMenuBar.reset()` rebuilds (and would
    re-create) the menus, but it is only called from its own constructor and from
    `FreeColFrame`, which the classic UI does not use.
  - **Dropdown reskin — done (Phase 3 §3).** The dropdown popups now get
    `ClassicDialog`'s wood-framed, green-on-wood palette too — see "Menu dropdowns"
    below. *Triggering* a few items still reaches `GUI` methods the classic UI
    no-ops (unrelated to the look).
- **Menu dropdowns — `ClassicGUI.installClassicMenuDropdownDefaults`.** Reuses
  `ClassicDialog`'s palette (`WOOD_FALLBACK`/`TEXT_FG`/`BORDER_HI`/`BORDER_LO`/
  `BTN_BG`/`BTN_FG`/`COUNT_FG`, now package-visible for this) rather than
  restyling each `JMenuItem` after construction: the colours are installed as
  `UIManager` *defaults* once, at start-up (from `installLookAndFeel`, well
  before `reconnectGUI` ever builds the `InGameMenuBar`), so every
  `JMenuItem`/`JCheckBoxMenuItem`/`JRadioButtonMenuItem`/`JPopupMenu` picks them
  up as its own built-in look at construction — no component is touched
  individually, and the real `FreeColAction`s/accelerators/`updateActions()`
  wiring are untouched.
  - **The idle/hover asymmetry (found live, not guessed).**
    `FreeColMenuBar.getMenuItem()` (shared with `SwingGUI`, so not touched here)
    leaves every item `setOpaque(false)`. Screenshotting an open dropdown at
    rest and mid-hover showed what that actually does: Swing's
    `BasicMenuItemUI.paintBackground` skips an item's *idle* background fill
    when non-opaque (so idle items show no rectangle of their own and sit
    directly on the popup's wood fill), but paints the *armed/hover* fill
    unconditionally regardless of opaque — an asymmetry easy to get backwards
    from reading the source alone. Left unaddressed, hover would have shown the
    platform L&F's own default blue; `MenuItem.selectionBackground` (etc.) is
    therefore set to `ClassicDialog`'s `BTN_BG` (its darker plate tone — not
    `BTN_HOT`, which is numerically identical to `WOOD_FALLBACK` and so would
    have been invisible against the popup).
  - **Popup chrome.** `PopupMenu.background`/`.border` give the popup itself
    `WOOD_FALLBACK` and a bevelled `BORDER_HI`/`BORDER_LO` border (`JPopupMenu`
    is forced opaque by `BasicPopupMenuUI` regardless of the item quirk above).
    Separators get both eras of the relevant `UIManager` key
    (`Separator.*`/`PopupMenu.separator*Foreground/Background`, since which one
    a given JDK's `JSeparator` UI delegate reads varies) plus a per-instance
    fallback in `styleClassicMenuBar` for belt-and-suspenders.
  - **Scope.** Only `MenuItem`/`CheckBoxMenuItem`/`RadioButtonMenuItem`/
    `PopupMenu`/`Separator` `UIManager` keys are touched, safe process-wide for
    the same reason as the F-key remap below: `--classic` is the only `GUI` this
    process ever runs, and the still-Swing choice/input dialog stopgaps
    (`JOptionPane`, Phase 3 §1) read different keys, so this cannot bleed into
    them. Checkbox/radio glyphs themselves stay the platform default (out of
    scope — only `FreeColLookAndFeel`, deliberately not installed, supplies
    custom ones).
  - **Verified live** (2026-07-26): all five menus (Game/View/Orders/Report/
    Colopedia), open and mid-hover, screenshotted; the F-key remap below still
    reads correctly through the reskin (including the confirmed Naval/Military
    F7 collision); 0 SEVERE in `FreeCol.log`.
- **`ClassicInfoPanel` — the right strip.** A fixed-width (240px) `Graphics2D`-
  painted panel echoing the original's right column, backed by the original's
  **`WOODPANL.PIK`** wood-panel texture (`paintWoodChrome`, washed slightly darker
  so the gold/parchment text keeps contrast; flat dark ground when the pack is
  absent). `WOODPANL.PIK` has a dark ornamental border on all four edges, so
  tiling the whole image repeats its top/bottom border mid-strip as hard
  horizontal seams; instead `paintWoodChrome` tiles only the **central grain band**
  (the borderless middle 40% of the source) — the left/right border *columns* are
  full-height so they stay continuous and keep the framed look, while the seams
  fall in uninterrupted wood — and **flips every other copy vertically** so
  adjacent copies meet at a matching grain edge (a mirror fold) rather than a hard
  discontinuity. It
  reads live state directly from the model (`game.getTurn()`, `player.getGold()`
  / `getTax()`) and from the `ClassicMapViewer`'s view state (`getActiveUnit` /
  `getSelectedTile`), showing top-to-bottom: the **minimap** (at the very top, as
  in the original — `paintMinimap` draws the map viewer's cached raster scaled to
  the strip width, framed, with the viewport box, and recentres the map on a
  click; see "Minimap raster" above); turn (season+year), gold, tax; then
  the active unit — its localized `getLabel` on its own line, then a **portrait**
  (`paintUnitPortrait`: the unit's map sprite on a dark plate, left of the
  `getMovesAsString` / terrain lines, as the original puts a sprite beside each
  unit — design ref `opening_006`/`opening_008`; the name keeps a full-width line
  because our localized labels, "Pionier (Freier Kolonist)", are far longer than
  Col1's and would not fit beside a 36px portrait in a 240px strip). The `ICONS.SS`
  sprites are ~16px, so the portrait up-scales them **nearest-neighbour**, the same
  crisp-pixels treatment the map gives them. In TERRAIN mode the selected tile's
  terrain shows instead; then the **order buttons** (below); and a bottom reminder
  of the classic order keys (Enter / Space / W, each followed by its **localized**
  action name via the reused `endTurnAction`/`skipUnitAction`/`waitAction` `.name`
  keys). It
  is repainted by `ClassicGUI`'s `repaintInfo()` on every
  `changeView`/`refresh`/`refreshTile`, so it tracks the active unit and treasury
  live (verified: moving the ship updated Moves 5/5 → 3/5 and the terrain line). The
  Gold/Tax/Moves captions are localized (`gold`/`tax`/`infoPanel.moves`).
- **Order buttons (the "orders" half).** The panel's lower half hosts the original's
  unit-order buttons by **reusing the real `FreeColAction`s** (the sanctioned "reuse
  `action/`" path). Each order action carries its own four-state order-button art
  (`FreeColAction.BUTTON_IMAGE`, populated from `ImageLibrary.getButtonImages`),
  enables itself via `shouldBeEnabled`, and its `actionPerformed` drives the real
  `InGameController`. `paintOrderButtons` walks a curated id list
  (`fortifyAction`, `sentryAction`, `buildColonyAction`, `roadAction`, `plowAction`,
  `clearForestAction`, `waitAction`, `skipUnitAction`, `disbandUnitAction`), looks
  each up in the `ActionManager`, and paints the `BUTTON_IMAGE` of every one that is
  **currently enabled** into a wrapped icon grid — recording each rectangle so
  `onClick` can fire the matching action (`onHover` highlights). Because the buttons
  read the same enabled state the menu items do (kept fresh by the `updateActions()`
  wiring), they track the active unit automatically: a pioneer shows fortify / sentry
  / build-colony / road / plow / clear / wait / skip / disband, a ship a different
  set. Verified live: the pioneer's two button rows render with the real art and
  hover-highlight, and clicking **build colony** opens the founding confirm dialog
  (proving click→action). **Still not ported** (later slices): the in-panel minimap
  (the map viewer still draws its own bottom-left overlay), a unit portrait, the
  wood-panel (`WOODPANL.PIK`) chrome, and the remaining key-hint captions.

## Colony screen (`ClassicColonyPanel`)

The signature original screen (design ref: the expert's `opening_016/017`,
"Northern Sugar"). Everything is painted into a virtual **320×200** canvas (the
original's VGA size) then up-scaled by the largest integer factor that fits the
window, nearest-neighbour — so the layout constants read straight off the
screenshots and the classic pixels stay crisp. Reached by clicking an owned
colony on the map (`ClassicMapViewer.onClick → gui.showColonyPanel`) or founding
one with **B**; hosted in its own `JFrame` (no `Canvas`). Layout, top to bottom:

- **Title bar** — colony name, turn and gold, gold-on-black.
- **Buildings pane** (left) — the colony's buildings on the sandy ground
  (`TERRAIN.SS.001`, tiled), each drawn from the original **`BUILDING.SS`** sprite
  set with the colonists working inside it and a black production tag
  (`amount` + goods icon). Names show **on hover** only (as in the original),
  which also keeps them from overlapping; the hover targets are the building
  bounds recorded during paint. *This slice flows the buildings left-to-right in
  rows rather than at the original's fixed ground positions — a documented
  deviation pending the expert's slot map.*
- **Tile pane** (right) — the **3×3 work-tile grid** on the wood panel
  (`WOODTILE.SS`), the colony in the centre cell and its eight neighbours around
  it. Each cell is placed by the work tile's compass `Direction` from the colony
  (`cellForDirection`), **not** its raw `(x,y)` offset — FreeCol's map is
  isometric, so the eight neighbours' raw offsets do not fill a −1..+1 square
  (the same isometric-vs-rectangular gotcha as the map viewer; placing by raw
  offset left cells empty). Each cell draws the same terrain art as the map, plus
  the colonist working it (green-boxed) and its production tag.
- **Bottom band** — the original **`COLONY.PIK`** chrome (320×72) blitted as-is,
  with the live figures over it: the SoL/tory split and the units standing in the
  colony (left), the ships in port or the empty-dock caption (middle), the net
  production (right), and the 16-slot **warehouse** row of goods icons + amounts
  along the very bottom. The red **"E"** at the bottom-right (part of the
  `COLONY.PIK` art) and **Escape** both close the screen.

**Provisional `BUILDING.SS` frame map (`BUILDING_FRAMES`).** Which of the 48
frames is which building was read off a labelled montage by eye. The clearly
distinct sets are certain (fortification walls; dock/drydock/shipyard; the sooty
blacksmith chain; the churches; the banner town hall), but several
interchangeable house/shop/factory chains are best-effort — hence the hover name,
which lets the expert spot a mis-mapped sprite and correct the table from a shot.

**Verified live (2026-07-14):** sailed the start ship to land, disembarked a
pioneer (the multi-unit disembark choice dialog now works), founded a colony with
**B** (the site-warnings confirm dialog now works), clicked it — the colony
screen renders (buildings, the filled 3×3 grid with the colony centred, the
`COLONY.PIK` band with SoL/port/production/warehouse), hover shows building names,
Escape closes it. 0 SEVERE.

### The build queue (`ClassicBuildQueuePanel`) — the first hard blocker, closed

Until this slice, `GUI.showBuildQueuePanel(Colony)` returned `null` unconditionally (an unoverridden
no-op): a colony could accumulate hammers/tools but the player had no way to ever tell it what to
build — not "rough," a genuine dead end for actually playing a game to a finish.

**The seam.** `ClassicGUI.showBuildQueuePanel` opens `ClassicBuildQueuePanel` in a window of its own
(the same one-window-at-a-time, guarded-`SwingUtilities.invokeLater` convention as every other classic
screen), positioned relative to the colony screen when one is open. **Reached by clicking the
construction indicator** — a new dark, gold-bordered band at the top of the buildings pane (above the
first building row, which shifted down `CONSTR_H` to make room) showing the colony's current build
target's icon, name and the goods still needed, or a "nothing being built" caption — mirroring
FreeCol's own `ConstructionPanel`, whose click likewise opens `showBuildQueuePanel` (same seam, same
click target, just reused rather than invented). ⚠️ The construction band **must paint after**
`paintBuildings`, not before: `paintBuildings` unconditionally re-fills the *entire* ground rectangle
(`fillTiled` over `AREA_Y..BAND_Y`) as its first step, which silently erases anything drawn earlier in
that region — this bit the first cut of this slice (the band was invisible) before the paint order was
swapped in `paintComponent`.

**The picker itself is deliberately not FreeCol's `BuildQueuePanel`.** That panel is a
drag-reorderable multi-item queue (MigLayout lists, `TransferHandler` drag-and-drop) — a modern
convenience the 1994 original never had. The original offered a simple list of what is *currently*
buildable and you picked one thing at a time, so `ClassicBuildQueuePanel` mirrors that instead: every
`BuildableType` (building or buildable unit — wagons/artillery/ships are buildable too) the colony can
legally build **right now** — `Colony.canBuild(BuildableType)` alone is sufficient filtering, since it
already excludes buildings already built/mid-upgrade, population/ability/limit shortfalls and
non-coastal mismatches, the same checks FreeCol's own panel runs by hand — listed with its icon
(`ImageLibrary.getSmallBuildableTypeImageWithWithSize`, the same lookup FreeCol's own row renderer
uses), name and remaining required goods (`Colony.getRequiredGoods`, icon+amount tags, right-aligned).
The colony's current pick is highlighted green; **clicking a row calls
`InGameController.setBuildQueue(colony, List.of(picked))` — replacing the queue with that one item —
and closes the screen**, exactly like choosing from the original's build menu. No reference screenshot
of the original's actual build-selection screen has surfaced (checked `screenshots/`), so the plain
list-over-a-dark-plate look is a considered placeholder in the same gold/green palette as the other
screens, not a faithfulness claim — an open item for the expert, like the popup metrics.

**The refresh gap this surfaced.** `InGameController.setBuildQueue`'s `updateGUI` only refreshes the
map controls and menu bar (`gui.updateMapControls()` / `gui.updateMenuBar()`) — it never calls
`GUI.refresh()`. Left alone, the colony screen behind the build-queue window would keep showing the
*old* construction indicator after a pick until some unrelated event (ending the turn, reopening the
screen) forced a repaint. So `showBuildQueuePanel`'s close callback also calls the same `repaintInfo()`
every other model-change hook uses — and, since the colony screen was never wired into that hook at
all before now (only the info panel and Europe screen were), this slice adds a `colonyPanel` field
and a `refresh()` method to `ClassicColonyPanel`, mirroring the Europe screen's existing
`europePanel.refresh()`, so the colony screen now also repaints on the general `refresh()`/
`refreshTile()`/`changeView*` path, not just after a build pick.

**Verified live (2026-07-24):** founded a colony, opened the build queue from the construction band —
the list rendered real hammers/tools costs (`Schmiede 64🔨/20🔧`, `Lagerhaus 80🔨`, …) with **Anlegestelle**
(Docks, the colony's real default pick) highlighted; picked **Lagerhaus** — the band updated to
"Lagerhaus" immediately on close (confirming the refresh fix, not just the underlying `setBuildQueue`
call); reopened and picked **Schmiede** — updated live again. 0 SEVERE throughout.

**Follow-ups (later slices, need the expert's sign-off):** validate/correct the
`BUILDING.SS` frame map; the original's fixed building ground-slots (vs. our
flow layout); per-nation building/flag tints; a reference shot for the
build-selection screen's actual look (Q-worthy, see above). Loading cargo and
caption localization are both closed — see "Cargo & set sail" and "Caption
localization" below.

### Work assignment (drag interaction) — the colony-screen blocker, closed

Until this slice, a colonist could be *founded into* a colony (via `B` on the map) but never told
*where* to work once inside: the colony screen only rendered the buildings/work-tile grid and let you
pick a build target, so a newly arrived colonist had no path to a job without leaving the screen and
finding some other, non-existent seam.

**The seam.** `InGameController.work(Unit, WorkLocation)` — `Building` and `ColonyTile` both implement
`WorkLocation`, so the one call handles moving a colonist into either. It already claims an unowned
tile and confirms abandoning education when needed, so `ClassicColonyPanel` calls it directly with no
extra guarding, the same way `boardShip` needed none for Europe boarding.

**Click-to-select, click-to-target — not drag-and-drop**, continuing the pattern of every other
classic screen (order buttons, report rows, the build queue, Europe boarding). `ClassicColonyPanel`
gained a `selectedUnit` field: clicking any colonist sprite on the screen — standing idle in the
colony (the population panel's own unit row, the very case that was previously a dead end), already
working a building, or already working a tile — selects it (a second click on the same unit
deselects); while one is selected, every building and every non-centre work-tile cell gets a gold hint
border, mirroring Europe's `BOARD_HINT` treatment of ships during boarding. Clicking a building or
tile then calls `InGameController.work(selectedUnit, target)` and clears the selection.
`paintWorkers` (used by both the buildings pane and the work-tile grid) and `paintPopulation` now
record each drawn colonist's virtual-space bounds + unit into shared `unitBounds`/`unitTargets` lists,
rebuilt once per paint (unlike `buildingBounds`, which only one method populates, these three
populating methods all run within a single `paintComponent` pass, so the lists are cleared once at
its top rather than per-method). `paintBuildings`/`paintWorkTiles` separately record `buildingTargets`/
`tileTargets` parallel to their existing bounds lists as the click-to-move targets.

**The refresh gap, again.** `InGameController.work`'s `updateGUI` has the same shape as `setBuildQueue`
and `boardShip` — it only refreshes map controls and the menu bar, never calls `GUI.refresh()` — so
`assignWork` calls the panel's own `refresh()` after the controller call, unconditionally (matching
`ClassicEuropePanel.boardSelected`), rather than leaving the screen showing the colonist in its old
spot until an unrelated repaint.

**Verified live (2026-07-25):** resumed the save with **Nieuw Amsterdam** (1 colonist, working the
Town Hall, producing 4 bells); clicked the Town Hall's colonist — it gained a selection box and every
building/work-tile gained a gold hint border; clicked the chapel — the real server call fired and was
correctly *rejected* (`CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`, shown via the existing `showErrorPanel` popup — see Phase 3
— not a bug, a legitimate validation failure); re-selected the same colonist and clicked the NW work
tile instead — the colonist moved there live, the Town Hall's production tag dropped to 1 (base, no
worker) and the tile gained a "3" grain production tag plus a matching net-production entry in the
band, all without leaving or reopening the screen. 0 SEVERE throughout (only the pre-existing benign
first-launch `options.xml` warning and the expected `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` client warning).

**Follow-ups:** the original's fixed building ground-slots remain a flow layout (Q5, unchanged by this
slice); loading cargo and per-nation tints are still open, tracked above.

## Europe screen (`ClassicEuropePanel`)

The original's home-port dock (design ref: the expert's `opening_009`–`013`).
Built exactly like the colony screen — painted into a virtual **320×200** canvas
and up-scaled by the largest integer factor that fits, nearest-neighbour, hosted
in its own `JFrame` (no `Canvas`). The original **`EUROPE.PIK`** harbour picture
(sky, sea, the wooden piers, the row of European town houses) is blitted as the
backdrop (loaded straight by its pack key `image.classic_original.pik.EUROPE.PIK`,
with a plain sea/sky fallback when the pack is absent); the live figures are drawn
over it. Layout:

- **Title bar** — port name, turn, tax and treasury, gold on black.
- **Action buttons** (top right) — the three golden buttons **Anwerben / Kaufen /
  Ausbilden** (recruit / purchase / train). Their virtual-space bounds + actions
  are recorded during paint so `onClick`/`onHover` can drive them (hover
  highlights). Each opens a **plain Swing choice dialog** listing the priced
  options and calls the **real controller** — recruit via
  `InGameController.recruitUnitInEurope(index)` over `europe.getExpandedRecruitables`,
  train/purchase via `trainUnitInEurope(unitType)` over the spec's
  `getUnitTypes{Trained,Purchased}InEurope` (cheapest first). This mirrors the
  standard `RecruitPanel` / `NewUnitPanel` exactly (both of those also route
  purchase through `trainUnitInEurope`). The dialogs are the same stopgap as the
  colony-founding seams; Phase 3 reskins them to the wood-framed look with the
  colonist portrait (`opening_011`–`013`).
- **Ships in port** — the naval units in Europe, floating on the water by the piers.
- **Units on the docks** — the land units in Europe, standing on the quay (wrapping
  onto a second rank).
- **Sailing rows** — the high-seas units split by heading (to-America vs to-Europe,
  keyed on `unit.getDestination() instanceof Europe`), each a caption + sprites.
- **Market row** — every storable good with its current sale price
  (`market.getPaidForSale`) along the bottom, on a dark plate.
- **Exit** — the red "E" at the bottom-right (part of the `EUROPE.PIK` art) and
  **Escape** both close the screen.

**Reaching it — the `updateActions()` fix.** The Europe screen is opened by the
reused `EuropeAction` (the **Europe** menu item, accelerator **E**) or
automatically when a ship arrives in Europe (the controller calls
`showEuropePanel`). The menu item is the intended trigger, but the reused
`FreeColAction`s were **stuck disabled** in the classic HUD: `SwingGUI` refreshes
their enabled state through the `Canvas` on every view change / panel open, and
the classic UI has no `Canvas`, so `EuropeAction` (and the map/turn menu items)
never re-evaluated `shouldBeEnabled` after construction. `ClassicGUI.updateActions`
(→ `FreeColClient.updateActions` → `ActionManager.update`) is now called on
`reconnectGUI` and every `changeView`, so the menu items enable correctly. Only
one Europe screen is open at a time; `updateEuropeanSubpanels` (called by the
controllers after a recruit/train) and the `refresh` hooks repaint it.

**Verified live (2026-07-14):** **E** opens the Amsterdam port (backdrop, title,
the three localized buttons, a colonist on the dock, the market row); Anwerben
lists the recruitable (`Schuldknecht (200)`), Ausbilden the cheapest trainable
(`Erfahrener Erzschürfer (600)`), Kaufen the cheapest purchasable
(`Artillerie (500)`) — each calling the real controller; Escape closes. 0 SEVERE.

### Boarding — the second hard blocker, closed

Until this slice, `ClassicEuropePanel` had click handling for its action buttons and the exit only:
nothing put a recruited/trained/purchased colonist standing on the dock onto a waiting ship. Once a
unit is already at sea or ashore, the *map's* ordinary movement already triggers real embark/disembark
and the high-seas "sail?" confirm (`InGameController.moveEmbark`/`moveTowardEurope`, reached through
`ClassicMapViewer`'s existing movement-key wiring) — it was specifically the Europe screen's own
dock↔ship interaction that was unwired, and without it no new colonist could ever reach the New World.

**Click-to-select, click-to-target — not drag-and-drop.** `InGameController.boardShip(Unit, Unit
carrier)` already does exactly what is needed (validates the unit/carrier share a location, asks the
server to embark, updates the GUI) and is directly callable — its Javadoc says "Called from
CargoPanel, TilePopup" (standard-UI seams), but nothing about it is standard-UI-specific. So
`ClassicEuropePanel` gained a `selectedUnit` field: clicking a unit on the dock selects it (a green
box, a second click on the same unit deselects), and while one is selected every ship in port gets a
gold hint border; clicking a ship then calls `boardShip(selectedUnit, ship)` and clears the selection.
This fits the click-driven style every other classic screen already uses (order buttons, report rows,
the build queue above) rather than introducing drag-and-drop as a new interaction paradigm this
codebase doesn't otherwise have. `paintPort`/`paintDocks` now record each sprite's virtual-space bounds
+ unit (parallel `Rectangle`/`Unit` lists, rebuilt every paint) the same way the action buttons already
did, rather than inventing a new hit-testing mechanism.

**Verified live (2026-07-24):** advanced turns until a ship arrived in port (`Auf dem Weg nach Europa`
→ docked) alongside a colonist already standing on the dock; clicked the colonist — a green selection
box appeared and the ship gained a gold hint border; clicked the ship — the colonist vanished from the
dock (boarded), the hint cleared. 0 SEVERE.

**Follow-ups:** the wood-framed dialog reskin (shared Phase-3 component); refining the dock/pier sprite
positions against the original. Cargo and set-sail, the two items this note used to flag as open, are
closed — see below. Caption localization is also closed — see below.

### Cargo & set sail — the Europe screen's last blocker, closed

Until this slice, `ClassicEuropePanel` had no way to move *goods* (as opposed to colonists) on or off a
ship, or to send a docked ship back to the New World — a ship could arrive in Europe and sit there
forever, since nothing in the screen itself could load it with cargo or start its return trip.

**Selection now does double duty.** `selectedUnit` (the same field boarding already used) now holds
either a dock colonist *or* a ship, disambiguated by `Unit.isNaval()`: clicking a ship in port calls the
new `selectPortUnit`, which boards a selected colonist onto it if one is selected (the existing
behaviour, unchanged) or otherwise selects/deselects the ship itself as the target for the actions
below — switching selection between a colonist and a ship is just overwriting the one field, no extra
state needed. While a ship is selected, every market-row good gets the same gold `BOARD_HINT` border
the boarding ships got while a colonist was selected, and the ship's own cargo hold renders as a strip
of goods icons (`paintCargo`, `Unit.getCompactGoodsList()`) in the gap above the piers — empty, and
undrawn, unless a ship is currently selected.

**Three click targets, three controller calls, all reusing established real seams:**
- **A market-row good** → `loadMarketGood` → `InGameController.buyGoods(type, amount, ship)`, capped at
  one `GoodsContainer.CARGO_SIZE` (100) per click — the same amount and the same call `MarketLabel`
  makes when a market icon is dragged onto the standard UI's `CargoPanel`.
- **A cargo icon on the selected ship** → `sellCargo` → `InGameController.unloadCargo(goods, false)`,
  which (since the carrier is in Europe) routes to `sellGoods` internally — the same call `GoodsLabel`
  makes when a cargo icon is dragged off a carrier.
- **The new fourth action button, "Segel setzen" (Set Sail)** → `setSail` → `InGameController.moveTo(
  ship, game.getMap())` — the literal "set sail" seam (Javadoc: "Called from
  EuropePanel.DestinationPanel"). Mirrors the standard (non-classic) Europe screen's own Set Sail
  button (`EuropePanel#sailAction`, key `S`) down to reusing its `setSail` i18n key, since no screenshot
  of the original's own set-sail affordance has surfaced — a placeholder in the same vein as the
  build-queue picker, open for the expert. It also mirrors that button's one safety check: if
  auto-load-emigrants is off and a colonist is still waiting on the dock, it confirms first (the classic
  UI's own wired `modalConfirmDialog`, same `europePanel.leaveColonists` template) before leaving them
  behind. Loading and selling keep the ship selected, so several goods types can be bought or sold in
  one visit — a deliberate difference from boarding/work-assignment's clear-after-one-click convention,
  since cargo is inherently a multi-item action even in the standard UI's own drag interface.

**A real bug caught live, not by inspection.** The first cut built the goods-to-load as
`new Goods(game, europe, type, amount)` and called `InGameController.loadCargo`, mirroring that
method's own doc comment ("branches on `goods.getLocation() instanceof Europe` → calls `buyGoods`
internally"). Live testing threw immediately: `Goods`'s constructor rejects any location whose
`getGoodsContainer()` is null, and `Europe` has no goods container — so a `Goods` located `Europe` can
never legally exist, and `loadCargo`'s Europe branch is (at least via this path) unreachable in
practice. Every real caller that buys goods in Europe (`MarketLabel`, `QuickActionMenu`) in fact calls
`buyGoods` directly rather than going through `loadCargo` — `loadMarketGood` now does the same, and the
crash is gone. Left as a loose thread for whoever next touches `InGameController`: `loadCargo`'s Europe
branch may be genuinely dead code.

**Verified live (2026-07-25):** opened Amsterdam with a ship in port and a colonist on the dock; clicked
the ship — green selection box, every market good gained a gold hint border; clicked a market good
(before the `buyGoods` fix, this threw the `Goods`-construction `RuntimeException` above — confirmed
gone after the fix, buyGoods correctly rejected the purchase for insufficient gold with no crash and no
stray hint left behind); clicked **Segel setzen** — the wood-framed confirm fired for real ("Sollen wir
die Segel nach Neuholland setzen und die Kolonisten zurücklassen?", ship portrait, `europePanel.
leaveColonists`, the first live trigger of this specific event-confirm dialog); confirmed — the ship
left port and reappeared correctly in the "Auf dem Weg nach Amerika" sailing row, the market hints
cleared, the colonist stayed behind on the dock as warned. Re-selected the dock colonist afterward (no
ship left in port) to confirm the dual-purpose selection still boards/selects correctly with an empty
port list. 0 SEVERE throughout except the pre-existing benign first-launch `options.xml` warning.

**Follow-ups:** selling/loading were only exercised on the reject path (the test save had 0 gold) — the
success path is un-exercised beyond code review, though it is a one-line delegation to the same
`unloadCargo`/`buyGoods` calls already proven elsewhere. The `loadCargo`-is-Europe-dead-code loose
thread above; the wood-framed dialog reskin (shared Phase-3 component, same as boarding); per-nation
tints.

## Report screens (`ClassicReportPanel` + concrete reports)

The original 1994 game's full-screen **advisor reports** (design ref: the
expert's `opening_014`/`opening_015` shots, plus the dedicated report-shot batch
in `screenshots/Berichte_fuer_Pascal/`). All **twelve** are built — the
original's ten, plus Labour and Foreign Affairs (both reversed-in / newly built
2026-07-24, see their own sections below) — sharing one frame.

**Key scheme (2026-07-24).** Report accelerators now follow the *observed*
original F-key layout (`00_BERICHTE-Menu_Tastenbelegung`: F2 Religious, F3
Congress, F4 Labour, F5 Trade, F6 Colony, F7 Naval, F8 Foreign Affairs, F9
Indian — no shift-F* layer at all) rather than FreeCol's own arbitrary one
(that file's F1 Religious, F3 Colony, F4 Foreign Affairs, F2 Labour, etc. — a
layout with nothing to do with Col1). `ClassicGUI.remapClassicReportAccelerators`
does this **at runtime only**, mutating the shared `FreeColAction` objects'
`ACCELERATOR_KEY` in memory — it never touches `FreeColMessages.properties`,
which is shared with `SwingGUI` and would silently re-map the standard game's
shortcuts too. Safe because `--classic` exclusively selects `ClassicGUI` for
the whole process (`FreeColClient`'s GUI selector), so a standard-UI session
never shares a process — or these mutated objects — with a classic one. Same
trick as `styleClassicMenuBar` below: reuse the shared component, restyle only
this process's copy.

Covers only the **six reports with a confirmed Col1 counterpart** plus the two
new ones — eight remaps. **Deliberately leaves Military / Production /
Exploration / Cargo's keys untouched**: none of those four has a confirmed
original counterpart (see "Which reports are actually Col1's" below), so
reassigning them is a call for the user/expert, not this fix.

**The subsection headings below now show each report's *new*, post-remap key.**
The dated "Verified live" notes further down were captured *before* the remap
and describe the keys actually pressed at the time — read those as historical
record, not current bindings.

### Which reports are actually Col1's

Cross-referencing the ten reports built before this session against the
observed F-key menu: **confirmed matches** (right concept, previously the
wrong key) — Colony↔Kolonieberater(F6), Naval↔Flotteninspektor(F7),
Trade↔Wirtschaftsberater(F5), Religious↔Religionsberater(F2),
Congress↔Kontinentalkongress(F3), Indian↔Indianerberater(F9). **No confirmed
match in the expert's evidence:** Military, Production, Exploration, Cargo.
Worse, "Military Garrison" is *not* a separate top-level report in the observed
original — it is one of the two paged views *inside* the Colony Advisor (F6),
which our Colony Advisor already, independently, correctly cycles through (see
"Colony Advisor" below). So the standalone Military Advisor screen may be
duplicating something the original folds into Colony's paging, rather than
being its own report. **Not unilaterally reworked or removed** — recorded as
Q6 in the plan for the user/expert to decide.

### The shared frame (`ClassicReportPanel`)

`ClassicReportPanel` is the abstract base every report extends; it owns the
framing so a concrete report only supplies its backdrop, title and body. Like the
colony/Europe screens, everything is painted into a virtual **320×200** canvas
up-scaled by the largest integer factor that fits, nearest-neighbour, hosted in
its own `JFrame`. The base paints: the dimmed sepia `REPORTn.PIK` backdrop (loaded
by pack key, with a flat-sepia fallback when the pack is absent), the gold-on-black
**title bar** (localized report name), and the red **Okay** plate at the
bottom-right; **Escape** and clicking Okay both close it. Subclasses implement
`backgroundKey()`, `titleKey()` and `paintBody(Graphics2D)` (drawing the header +
rows between `ROW_Y0` and `BODY_BOTTOM`), and may override `onBodyClick(vx,vy)` for
extra click behaviour (default no-op). Shared drawing helpers (`drawFitted`,
`clip`, `font`, and `cap(key)` for captions) and the palette/layout constants live
on the base.

**Clickable colony rows.** A report that lists colonies calls
`addColonyRow(yBaseline, colony)` per row during paint (the base clears the hit
list each paint, before `paintBody`); the base then handles the rest — a click in a
row band closes the report and opens that colony's screen via
`getGUI().showColonyPanel(colony, null)` (a jump-to, as the original advisor does),
and the cursor turns to a hand over a clickable row. Wired in the Colony Advisor,
Production and Religious reports (the three that list colonies). The Okay-plate and
Escape close paths take priority over a row hit.

**Caption localization.** The reports' short captions — column heads, the Colony
Advisor's page subtitles, the Religious/Congress summary labels, the empty-state
lines — have no equivalent in the standard FreeCol UI, so they get their own keys
in an isolated `classic.report.*` block appended to
`FreeColMessages[_de].properties`, fetched through the base's `cap(tail)` helper
(`Messages.message("classic.report." + tail)`). The German block deliberately
gives the Colony Advisor its **original captions** — `classic.report.colony.sol`
= "Söhne der Freiheit", `classic.report.colony.military` = "Militärgarnision" —
matching `opening_015` / `opening_014`. The info panel's key-hint captions reuse
the existing `endTurnAction`/`skipUnitAction`/`waitAction` `.name` keys (the key
tokens Enter/Space/W stay literal, being our actual bindings).

**Verified live (2026-07-16, German locale, 0 SEVERE):** Trade heads render
"Waren / Netto / $"; Exploration "Region / Typ / Runde / Punkte"; Congress
"Rekrutierung / Glocken", "Gründervater / Kategorie", "Noch keine Gründerväter.";
the info-panel hints "Enter: Zug beenden / Space: Überspringen / W: Warten/Nächste
Einheit"; and the Colony Advisor pages between the two original captions —
**"Söhne der Freiheit"** and **"Militärgarnision"** — over "Noch keine Kolonien.".
Umlauts render correctly throughout.

**The colony/Europe screens turned out to already be fully localized** — an exhaustive literal-string
sweep of `ClassicColonyPanel`, `ClassicEuropePanel`, `ClassicBuildQueuePanel`, `ClassicReportPanel` and
every concrete report subclass (2026-07-26) found every paint-time string already routing through
`Messages.message(...)`, `Messages.getName(...)`, or `cap(tail)`. The one genuine hard-coded literal
outside those screens was `ClassicMapViewer.paintWaiting`'s pre-map-ready fallback string, drawn only in
the narrow `map == null || f == null` startup window before the map/focus are available. Fixed by adding
`classic.mapViewer.waitingForMap` next to the `classic.buildQueue.*` block. Two literals were deliberately
left alone: `ClassicInfoPanel`'s key-cap tokens (Enter/Space/W — our actual bindings, not translatable
concepts, per the comment above that code) and `ClassicGUI`'s `JOptionPane` title fallback to the
brand name "FreeCol" (a proper noun). Because `paintWaiting` fires only in a transient startup window,
this fix was verified at the code level (key resolves, `ant compile` clean, 0 SEVERE and no missing-key
warning in `FreeCol.log` at startup) rather than by live screenshot — the same standard already applied
elsewhere in this doc when a state can't reliably be forced (e.g. the Colony Advisor's >9-colony paging).

**Row geometry (the invariant to keep).** A row's cell spans `[y-ROW_H+3, y+3)`
about its baseline `y`, and sprites are drawn from `y-ROW_H+4` — i.e. a row
occupies space *above* its own baseline. So the first row's baseline must sit a
full row-pitch below the column heads: `ROW_Y0 = HEAD_Y + ROW_H`. (An earlier
`ROW_Y0 = TITLE_H + 12` put the first row's sprites *above* the head baseline, so
every report's heads collided with its first row — most visibly the Cargo report's
sprites.) The two reports with a summary block above their table
(Religious, Congress) repeat the same relation locally with their own
`TABLE_HEAD_Y` / `TABLE_Y0 = TABLE_HEAD_Y + ROW_H`.

> ⚠️ **These layout constants are `static final int`, so javac *inlines* them into
> every report class.** `ant compile` only recompiles changed sources, so changing a
> constant on the base silently leaves untouched subclasses running the **old**
> value (this bit us: after fixing `ROW_Y0`, `ClassicReportTradePanel` — the one
> file not otherwise edited — still painted with the stale `21`). **Run
> `ant clean compile` after touching any shared constant**, not just `ant compile`.

**Wiring.** Every `showReport*Panel` override routes through one private
`ClassicGUI.showReport(titleKey, factory)` helper: it disposes any open report
(`closeReportPanel` — **one report window at a time**), builds the panel via the
factory (passing the close callback), frames it, and is guarded so a failure
degrades to a log line. Reached by the reused report menu items, enabled by the
same `updateActions()` wiring the Europe menu item needed. The remaining
`showReport*Panel` seams still no-op.

### Colony Advisor (`ClassicReportColonyPanel`, F6) — the paged report

The "KOLONIEBERATER-BERICHT" over the sepia fort illustration (**`REPORT6.PIK`**).
This is the one report that, as in the original, **pages through several column
sets** — the behaviour the expert's two shots document (`opening_014`,
`opening_015` are the *same* report on different pages, not different reports).

Every page keeps the same **left column** — the colony's flag sprite
(`getScaledSettlementImage`), a **population badge** (the boxed `getUnitCount()`
number, as in the original) and its name — and swaps what is drawn to the right,
with a **subtitle** naming the current page. The pages (the `Page` enum):

- **Sons of Liberty** (`opening_015`, the original's "Söhne der Freiheit") —
  `getSonsOfLiberty()` %, the building producing the colony's bells
  (`getWorkLocationForProducing(liberty)`, the original's "Druckerei" column; a new
  colony shows its *Rathaus*/Town Hall), the bells per turn
  (`getNetProductionOf(liberty)`) as icon+amount, and one colonist figure per SoL
  member.
- **Military Garrison** (`opening_014`, "Militärgarnison") — the offensive land
  units standing in the colony (`tile.getUnitList()` filtered by
  `isOffensiveUnit() && !isNaval()`) as sprites; none → "—".

> **The original shows no column heads** — the subtitle names the page and the
> columns are self-evident — so this panel deliberately paints none (and starts its
> rows a row-pitch below the *subtitle* via its own `PAGE_ROW_Y0`, keeping the same
> "a row's cell is drawn above its baseline" invariant).

**Paging interaction — confirmed live (2026-07-24):** the expert's menu capture
showed the original cycles pages by **pressing F6 again**, not arrow keys/Space
(the earlier guess, now replaced). This is a *local* binding on the report's own
`JFrame` — it never contends with the main frame's global F6 accelerator, since
the report window is a separate top-level window. Okay/Escape close as
everywhere else. Rows that overflow are clipped (no scroll yet — the *within-a-
view* paging key for >9 colonies is still open, see Q2 in the plan); empty →
"No colonies yet."

### Unit rosters — Military & Naval (`ClassicReportRosterPanel`)

`ClassicReportRosterPanel` is a second small base (over `ClassicReportPanel`) for
the reports that tally units by type×role, mirroring FreeCol's own
`ReportUnitPanel`. A subclass supplies backdrop, title, an `isReportable(Unit)`
predicate and an empty caption; the base groups the player's units
(`player.getUnits()`), keeps a sample for the sprite, **sorts by descending count
then label** (the unit set is unordered, so this keeps the roster stable), and
paints one row per group: sprite, the localized `Messages.getUnitLabel(...)`
type/role label, and the count.

- **Military Advisor** (`ClassicReportMilitaryPanel`, **F7** — unchanged by the
  remap; see "Which reports are actually Col1's" above) — the standing army
  over the fort illustration (**`REPORT6.PIK`** — the fortification is the garrison
  image; shared with the Colony Advisor, a framing the expert may re-assign once
  REPORT9 has a home). Reportable = FreeCol's `ReportMilitaryPanel` set:
  `!isNaval() && (hasAbility(EXPERT_SOLDIER) || isOffensiveUnit())`. Empty → "No
  military units."
- **Naval Advisor** (`ClassicReportNavalPanel`, confirmed key **F7** — currently
  collides with Military above, see Q6) — the fleet over the ship
  illustration (**`REPORT7.PIK`**). Reportable = `unit.isNaval()`. Empty → "No
  naval units."

### Trade Advisor (`ClassicReportTradePanel`, F5)

The goods ledger over the scales/candle/hourglass illustration (**`REPORT5.PIK`**).
Every storable good (`spec.getStorableGoodsTypeList()`) as **icon | name | Net |
$**: `Net` is the empire-wide net production summed over all colonies
(`Σ colony.getNetProductionOf(gt)`), `$` the market sale price
(`market.getPaidForSale(gt)`). Two goods per row (each occupies one 160px half —
the column origins are *within* a half, added to `col*HALF`) so the 21-good ledger
fits the canvas.

### Religious Advisor (`ClassicReportReligiousPanel`, F2)

Crosses/immigration over the preacher-and-congregation illustration
(**`REPORT2.PIK`**). A summary block at the top — accumulated immigration
(`player.getImmigration()` / `getImmigrationRequired()`) and empire-wide cross
output (`getTotalImmigrationProduction()`) with the cross goods icon — then one row
per colony with the crosses it produces (`Σ colony.getNetProductionOf(gt)` over the
`spec.getImmigrationGoodsTypeList()`). Empty → "No colonies yet."

### Production Report (`ClassicReportProductionPanel`, shift F4)

The per-colony production breakdown over the colony-under-construction
illustration (**`REPORT4.PIK`**). Where the Colony Advisor shows each colony's
*two* largest outputs and the Trade Advisor sums production empire-wide, this
lists **every** good a colony nets positively, as icon+amount along the row
(`colony.getNetProductionOf(gt)` over the storable goods, clipped when the row
fills). Empty → "No colonies yet."; a producing-nothing colony → "—". Its
per-colony row logic is shared with the (data-verified) Colony Advisor.

### Continental Congress (`ClassicReportCongressPanel`, F3)

The founding-father standing over the two-men-at-a-desk illustration
(**`REPORT3.PIK`**). A summary block — who is currently being recruited
(`player.getCurrentFather()`) and the liberty-bell progress toward them
(`getLiberty()` / `getTotalFoundingFatherCost()`, `+getLibertyProductionNextTurn()`
/turn) — then the roster of fathers already in Congress
(`player.getFoundingFathers()`): portrait (`lib.getFoundingFatherImage`), name and
category (`father.getTypeKey()`), grouped by type. Empty → "No founding fathers
yet."

### Exploration Report (`ClassicReportExplorationPanel`, shift F2)

The discovered regions over the map-and-wax-seal illustration (**`REPORT8.PIK`**) —
the same data as FreeCol's own `ReportExplorationPanel`: every `map.getRegions()`
with a non-null `getDiscoveredIn()`, as name | type | turn | score, newest first
(by discovered turn then score). Unnamed regions fall back to their localized type
name. Empty → "Nothing discovered yet."

### Cargo Report (`ClassicReportCargoPanel`, shift F1)

Each carrier's load, over the ship illustration (**`REPORT7.PIK`**, shared with the
Naval Advisor). Where the Naval Advisor tallies the fleet *by type*, this is one row
per carrier — the reportable set from FreeCol's own `ReportCargoPanel`
(`isCarrier() || canCarryTreasure()`) — showing its sprite and name, then the goods
it holds (`getCompactGoodsList()`, icon+amount) and the units aboard
(`getUnitList()`, sprites), clipped when the row fills. Nothing aboard → "(empty)";
no carriers → "No carriers."

### Indian Advisor (`ClassicReportIndianPanel`, F9)

The contacted native nations, over the native-scout illustration
(**`REPORT1.PIK`**). One row per native nation the player has **contacted**
(`player.hasContacted`, the same filter FreeCol's own `ReportIndianPanel` applies):
the tribe's capital settlement sprite
(`lib.getScaledSettlementTypeImage(nationType.getCapitalType())`), its name, the
number of its settlements the player knows of, and its tension toward the player
(`tribe.getTension(player)`, via `model.tension.*.name`). Empty → "No tribes
contacted yet."

> Unlike FreeCol's panel this deliberately omits the tribe's *true* settlement
> total: that comes from `igc().nationSummary()`, which a static paint must not
> drive — see "The `nationSummary` trap" below (the same trap the Foreign
> Affairs report below had to solve). The locally-known count is shown instead.

**Verified live (2026-07-15, pre-key-remap — see "Key scheme" above for the keys
these reports answer to today):** at the `--fast` start (at sea, no colonies) all ten
render framed over their correct backdrops with 0 SEVERE — **F3** "No colonies
yet."; **F7** the starting `Soldat (Freier Kolonist) ×1`; **F8** the starting
`Handelsschiff ×1`; **F9** the full 21-good two-column ledger with live sale prices;
**F1** "Immigration: 0 / 19", "Crosses per turn: +0"; **shift F4** "No colonies
yet."; **F6** "Recruiting: (none)", "Bells: 0 / 40 (+0/turn)", "No founding fathers
yet."; **shift F2** the three regions already discovered at the start (*Acadie* T2
sc66, *Newfoundland* T2 sc38, *Chile* T1 sc74), newest first; **shift F1** the
starting ship *Salm (Handelsschiff)* with the colonist aboard (the other starting
unit is the pioneer already ashore, so it is correctly absent from the hold);
**F5** "No tribes contacted yet." All localize (German) via the reused message keys
and `Messages.getName`/`getUnitLabel`. Escape/Okay close each; opening another
report replaces the previous window.

**Verified with a live colony (2026-07-15).** The `--fast` start put the active
unit ashore as a **Pionier** (the documented variant), so **B** → confirm the site
warnings founded *Nieuw Amsterdam* directly, no sailing needed. With it standing:

- **F3** both pages, with the row data matching `opening_015`'s shape — *Sons of
  Liberty*: flag, pop badge `1`, `Nieuw Amst…`, `0%`, **`Rathaus`**, bells `4`; then
  **Right** → *Military Garrison*: same left column, `—` (the colonist works inside,
  so it is correctly not a garrison unit); **Right** again wraps back.
- **shift F4** *Nieuw Amster…* with its furs `+2`; **F1** *Nieuw Amsterdam* `+1`
  crosses — closing those two row loops' verification gap. 0 SEVERE throughout.

> **Verification caveat — the row loops still unproven with data.** **Congress**
> (needs a founding father) and **Indian** (needs native contact) have so far only
> run through their empty-state branch. Populate them when next testing near that
> code. Note founding a colony also puts a road on its tile and turns the founding
> pioneer into a plain colonist — that is the engine's own behaviour, not a bug.

### The `nationSummary` trap

`InGameController.nationSummary(player)` is **a blocking server round-trip, not an
async callback** — an earlier note here and in the plan said otherwise. It reads
`myPlayer.getNationSummary(other)` and, **on a cache miss, calls
`askServer().nationSummary(…)` and waits** for the reply before returning.

So it must never be called from `paintComponent`: that is network I/O on the EDT,
on every repaint. Any report needing it has to fetch **once, off the EDT, when the
screen opens**, stash the results, and paint from the stash — a different shape
from every report shipped so far, all of which paint straight off the model. This
is why the Indian Advisor shows the locally-known settlement count, and it was
the main structural work in building the Foreign Affairs report below.

### Foreign Affairs Report (`ClassicReportForeignAffairPanel`, F8)

The "AUSSENPOLITIK-BERICHT" — the last report the original actually has, and now
built, closing the report set. Over the map-and-wax-seal illustration
(**`REPORT8.PIK`**): confirmed pixel-for-pixel against the expert's capture, and
in the process found to be **already double-booked** with the Exploration Report
above, which had only guessed at that backdrop — a real correction the expert's
shots surfaced (recorded as part of Q6, since it also means Exploration's own
backdrop claim is now less certain, on top of Exploration having no confirmed
Col1 counterpart at all).

**Layout — one fixed-height block per European power**, met or not, alive or
withdrawn, in game order, with the **viewer's own nation always last** (verified
against the capture's own save). Read directly off pixel scans of the raw
320×200 captures (not the point-scaled human-readable copies, which stretch to a
4:3 CRT aspect and would give wrong constants): a `RULE`-coloured horizontal line
opens each 45px block, then five 7px-pitch lines — name, colonies/avg size/
population, military/naval/merchant strength, stance, rebels/loyalists. A
withdrawn power's block instead shows just its name and a centred notice
(`classic.report.foreignAffairs.withdrawn`).

**Fields — deliberately not FreeCol's nine.** Matches the capture's own set:
colonies, average colony size, population, military strength, naval strength,
merchant-marine strength, stance (peace **yellow**, war **red** — colour-coded,
confirmed from the capture's side-by-side peace/war comparison shot), and
rebel/loyalist head counts. **Omits** gold, tax rate, Continental Congress
membership and Sons-of-Liberty % — all of which FreeCol's own
`ReportForeignAffairPanel` shows and this does not, the same
information-availability call already made for the other reports. The viewer's
own block instead lists its **stance toward every met rival**, one pair per
slot (an unmet or withdrawn power gets no entry there, per the capture).

**The two fields `NationSummary` didn't have — a small, additive model
extension, not a rules change.** Merchant-marine strength and rebel/loyalist
counts have no equivalent on `NationSummary` (the DTO `nationSummary()`'s server
round trip returns), and a rival's true figures are only ever knowable through
that DTO — the client's local copy of a rival `Player` is deliberately
incomplete. So `NationSummary` gained two small additions:
`mercantileMarine` (`NationSummary.computeMercantileMarine`, sum of
`Unit.getCargoCapacity()` over a player's naval units) and `rebels`/`loyalists`
(derived from population and `Player.getSoL()`). Both are **always computed**,
unlike `soL`/`foundingFathers`/`tax` on the same class, which stay gated behind
`Ability.BETTER_FOREIGN_AFFAIRS_REPORT` exactly as before — untouched, because
the capture shows Col1 exposes the *new* fields to every rival unconditionally,
but says nothing about the *existing* gated ones, so there was no evidence to
justify loosening them. Purely additive: new fields with sensible defaults, no
existing field, gate, or XML schema changed; `SwingGUI`'s own
`ReportForeignAffairPanel` doesn't read them, so it is unaffected.

**Fetched off the EDT, per the `nationSummary` trap above.**
`ClassicGUI.showReportForeignAffairPanel` spawns a background thread that
builds the full list of European powers (`game.getPlayers`, filtered to
European/non-REF/not-self, **including dead ones** — the capture's withdrawn
England stays on the list) and calls `nationSummary()` for each live one *before*
building the panel; the finished stash is handed to
`ClassicReportForeignAffairPanel` on the EDT via `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`,
which only ever paints from it. The viewing player's own block is read directly
off the local, always-authoritative `Player` instead — no round trip needed for
your own data.

**Verified live (2026-07-24, populated 4-nation save, 0 SEVERE):** all three
rivals (France, England — withdrawn, Spain) plus the viewer's own nation
rendered; colonies/population/military/naval/merchant figures and rebel/loyalist
splits all matched the underlying model; England's withdrawn block showed the
centred notice with no stats; the own-block stance line correctly showed no
entries in an unmet-everyone save. War/peace colour-coding is coded per the
capture but not yet live-tested against an actual war (the test save had none).

### Labour Advisor (`ClassicReportLabourPanel`, F4)

The "ARBEITSBERATER-BERICHT" — **a reversed decision**: previously filed as one
of the four FreeCol-only reports (`optional-reports.md`), until the expert's
capture (`F4_Arbeitsberater_Labor`) showed the original has this exact screen —
a three-column census of every "person" unit type the player owns, portrait +
localized name + count, **grouped exactly as the capture groups them**, not spec
order and not an arbitrary three-way split of it: primary-good producers
(farm/plantation/mine/trap/lumber) on the left, building/processing experts plus
the fisherman and preacher in the middle, and the "special" civil/military/other
roles on the right (`COLUMN_UNIT_IDS`, three hardcoded id lists). Over
**`REPORT4.PIK`** (a new double-booking, shared with the Production Report — the
dockside/warehouse scene matches both). A type with zero units still gets a row
(the capture shows `Jesuitenmissionare 0`) — only types unavailable to the
player's nation/ruleset are skipped.

**Row geometry read directly off pixel scans of the raw capture** (not the
point-scaled copy, same caveat as Foreign Affairs above): each entry is two
stacked lines (name, then count) in an 18px pitch — noticeably tighter than the
15px `ROW_H` every single-line report shares, since two lines have to fit where
one normally does, so this panel defines its own `ENTRY_H`/`FIRST_Y`/`COUNT_DY`
rather than reusing the base constants.

> ⚠️ **Clipping-margin bug found and fixed during live verification.** The first
> cut tested a row's fit against `y + ENTRY_H > BODY_BOTTOM` — the same shape as
> every other report's clipping check — but that demands the *next* row's full
> slot also fit, not just the current row's own content (which only reaches
> `y + COUNT_DY`). It silently dropped the ninth row of both 9-entry columns
> (`Mitreißender Prediger`, `Freie Siedler`) even though they visually fit with
> room to spare. Fixed by checking against the row's own content extent instead.
> The Foreign Affairs report above had the identical bug for the same reason (its
> own block-height check demanded a full next-block's headroom) — it silently
> dropped the **viewer's own nation** in a fully-populated 4-nation save, until
> fixed the same way (`BLOCK_CONTENT_H`, not `BLOCK_H`). Both were only caught by
> testing with data that actually filled every row/block — an idle/empty save
> would never have shown either.

**Deliberately not built: the capture's own "click to zoom" drill-down.** The
subtitle "(Zum Zoomen Objekt anklicken)" promises a per-type detail view
(FreeCol's `ReportLabourDetailPanel` equivalent) this slice does not build, so
the subtitle itself is **not painted** — showing it would advertise an
interaction that silently does nothing on click. The row geometry above already
reserves the caption's vertical space, so adding the drill-down later is a
self-contained follow-up, not a relayout. Education, History and Requirements
are **unaffected** by any of this — the capture says nothing about them, and
they remain deferred in `optional-reports.md`.

**Verified live (2026-07-24, a save with a colony elsewhere on the map, 0
SEVERE):** all three columns render over the correct backdrop; the visible unit
(a Free Colonist standing alone) and units in an off-screen colony (a Master
Carpenter) both counted correctly, confirming the census aggregates
`player.getUnitSet()` empire-wide rather than just what's on screen.

### High Scores (`ClassicReportHighScoresPanel`, F10 — no accelerator in either scheme)

The score breakdown — "Kolonisationspunkte" in the German menu — over the
records-at-a-desk illustration reused from the Continental Congress
(**`REPORT3.PIK`**, a guess; see below). Reached by the already-live **Spiel →
Punktzahlrekorde** menu item (`ReportHighScoresAction` → `InGameController.
highScore(null)` → a server round trip → `highScoresHandler(key, scores)` →
`getGUI().showHighScoresPanel(key, scores)`, already dispatched via
`invokeLater`), not by any of the F-key report shortcuts — FreeCol's own scheme
has no accelerator for this seam at all, so unlike every other report there was
no key-remap question to resolve.

**Differs in shape from every other report.** `GUI.showHighScoresPanel(String
messageId, List<HighScore> scores)` takes its data as arguments rather than
reading the live model from `paintBody` — the caller has already made the
server round trip before the classic override is ever invoked, so (unlike the
Foreign Affairs report's `nationSummary` trap) there is nothing to fetch off
the EDT here; `ClassicGUI.showHighScoresPanel` builds
`ClassicReportHighScoresPanel` synchronously and routes it through the same
`showReport` helper every other report uses.

**One row per `HighScore`, in the order given** (already best-first, per
`HighScore.tidyScores`): rank, score, the same localized governor/president-
of-nation headline the standard `ReportHighScoresPanel` shows (`report.
highScores.governor`/`.president`, reusing its exact `%name%`/`%nation%`
template), the retirement turn, and colony/unit counts. The standard panel's
other fields — difficulty, independence turn, the original/final nation name
and type, the retirement date — are read directly off `HighScore` too (see its
full accessor set), but are **not shown**: a single 320×200 screen has no room
for that panel's full nine-field-per-entry stacked layout, the same
information-availability call already made for the other reports (e.g.
Foreign Affairs' own deliberate omissions, see above). `messageId` (the
"highscores.yes"/"highscores.no" result of a just-finished game, when present)
prints as a line above the table; the space for it is always reserved so the
table's position does not shift between the two cases. An empty list (e.g. a
fresh profile's just-created, empty `HighScores.xml`) shows the same "no
scores yet" empty-state treatment every other report uses.

**Open, unconfirmed guesses (flagged, not settled):** no `REPORTn.PIK` backdrop
is confirmed for this screen at all — `REPORT3.PIK` (otherwise single-booked by
the Continental Congress) was picked as the closest thematic fit among the free
single-use backdrops (`REPORT1`/`2`/`3`/`5`), not because any capture confirms
it; the extracted-but-unused closing-sequence art (`CLOS-BKG`/`CCBKGD`) was
considered and passed over as riskier to reuse sight-unseen. The five-column
row layout and the choice of which `HighScore` fields to show at all are
likewise placeholders in the same vein as the build-queue picker's look —
open for the expert.

**Verified live (2026-07-26, `--fast` start, 0 SEVERE):** Spiel → Punktzahlrekorde
opens the panel over the sepia `REPORT3.PIK` backdrop with the localized title
"Punktzahlrekorde"; a fresh profile's empty `HighScores.xml` (created on first
read, logged at INFO) renders "Noch keine Punktzahlrekorde." per the empty-state
path; Okay closes it cleanly back to the map. **The populated-row path (the
table header and a real row) was only verified at the code level, not live** —
forcing an actual finished/retired game wasn't practical in this session, the
same documented fallback this doc already uses for other hard-to-force states
(e.g. the Colony Advisor's >9-colony paging, "The colony/Europe screens turned
out to already be fully localized" above).

### Follow-ups (later slices)

The expert's sign-off on the Colony Advisor's **within-a-view** paging key for
more than 9 colonies (the *between-views* key is now confirmed — see "Colony
Advisor" above); row scrolling for many entities generally. (Captions are
localized and colony rows are clickable now — see "Caption localization" and
"Clickable colony rows" above.) Education, History and Requirements remain
deferred to
[`classic_ui_plan/optional-reports.md`](../../../../../../../classic_ui_plan/optional-reports.md)
as possible later additions of our own, not missing work. The High Scores
screen's backdrop and row/field choices are open guesses — see "High Scores"
above.

## Popups (`ClassicDialog`) — and the dispatch seams that stranded them

The shared wood-framed popup every classic dialog routes through — the plan's
"build it once" for Phase 3. Like the reports it paints a virtual pixel canvas
(240 wide, height computed from the content) up-scaled ×3 nearest-neighbour, over
`ClassicWood` grain: an optional illustration at the left, wrapped green-on-wood
text, a centred row of raised option plates. Hosted in a modal `JDialog` (the
classic UI has no `Canvas`). Two entry points share the painting:

- `showMessages(owner, title, pages)` — pages through *n* notices one at a time
  with a single **Okay** plate and an `i/n` counter. The original has no batched
  turn-report screen, so both message seams page rather than list.
- `ask(owner, title, page, options, defaultIndex)` — a question with *n* plates,
  returning the index chosen (`-1` if dismissed). `Escape` dismisses, `Enter`
  takes the default.

Multi-page + multi-option is not meaningful (a page step consumes the plate), and
neither entry point builds one.

**`ClassicWood`** holds the seam-free grain tiling — the mirror-fold described
under `ClassicInfoPanel` — shared by the info strip and these popups.

### The dead dispatch seams (the actual bug)

`invokeNowOrLater` / `invokeNowOrWait` are **no-ops in the base `GUI`** (headless
has no EDT to reach), and `ClassicGUI` never overrode them. Every task routed
through them was therefore dropped on the floor, so the classic UI **silently
discarded every in-game notice**: `InGameController.displayModelMessages` posts
its display task through `invokeNowOrWait`, and `Message.clientGeneric` posts the
server-driven message flush (and sound) through `invokeNowOrLater`. Overriding
`showModelMessages`/`showReportTurnPanel` alone would have changed nothing —
they were never called. Both seams now mirror `SwingGUI`: run inline on the EDT,
else hand off.

This is the general hazard of building on a no-op base class: a seam you never
override fails *silently and invisibly*, and the two dispatch seams are
especially costly because they strand other seams rather than losing one screen.

### The no-op seam audit (2026-07-18)

Following that hazard to its conclusion: cross-referencing every `getGUI().X`
call in `client/control/*` against what `ClassicGUI` overrides turned up one
more silent-loss bug of the same class — **`showErrorPanel`** (below) — and
otherwise a reassuring picture:

- **Most confirms already work.** `confirmHostileAction` / `confirmLeaveColony`
  / `confirmStopGame` / `confirmClearTradeRoute` all delegate to
  `modalConfirmDialog`, which we override — so e.g. attacking an ally now
  prompts. `confirmPreCombat` hits a Phase-3 dialog no-op but is gated behind a
  client option that is off by default, so it degrades to "proceed".
- **Event dialogs are a genuine open sub-audit, deferred to Phase 3.**
  the event dialogs (monarch, emigration, naming, first-contact, native-demand)
  no-op'd today, and some *return a value that gates flow*. **Chasing this down
  found three real bugs, now fixed** — see "Event confirm dialogs" below. Two
  remain, tied to the Q4 widgets: `showEmigrationDialog` (pick 1 of 3 recruits —
  a choice) and `showNamingDialog` (name a colony/region — text input).

### Wired seams

- `showModelMessages(List<ModelMessage>)` — in-turn notices.
- `showReportTurnPanel(List<ModelMessage>)` — the end-of-turn batch.
  Each notice keeps FreeCol's own illustration for it
  (`ImageLibrary.getObjectImageIcon(game.getMessageDisplay(m))`).
- `modalConfirmDialog(Tile, StringTemplate, ImageIcon, …)` — replaces the plain
  `JOptionPane` stopgap. The `(…, Unit, …)` and `(…, FreeColObject, …)`
  overloads in `GUI` are `final` and delegate here, so every confirm in the game
  lands on this one override. A dismissed popup falls back to `defaultOk`.
  Window title is `colony(tile)` — the tile's colony, else **"FreeCol"**.
- `showErrorPanel(String, Runnable)` — the audit's find. All five `showErrorPanel`
  overloads are `final` and funnel into this one non-final seam, so a no-op meant
  **every error in the classic UI vanished**. Worse, some errors carry a
  `callback` due to run on close — the uncaught-exception handler in
  `FreeColClient` shows a *serious* error with a `System.exit` callback, so the
  no-op left the app hung, neither warning nor exiting. Now routes the message
  through the shared popup and runs the callback in a `finally` (so the exit path
  fires even if the popup throws). Error text currently uses the same green as a
  message — whether the original styled errors distinctly is an open expert
  question.

`modalChoiceDialog` / `modalInputDialog` remain plain Swing stopgaps: they need a
list widget and a text field, whose original look wants the expert's reference
shots first.

### Event confirm dialogs (async `DialogHandler<Boolean>`)

`showMonarchDialog` (the king's demands), `showFirstContactDialog` (meeting a
native nation) and `showNativeDemandDialog` (native tribute demand) — the three
event dialogs whose response is a yes/no. **Each was a real flow bug while it
no-op'd, not a missing screen:** the handler carries the player's answer back
over the wire (`answerMonarch` / `firstContact` / `indianDemand`), so with no
dialog the exchange silently dropped — a tax hike accepted by omission, the
player never offered a Tea Party.

Unlike `modalConfirmDialog` these seams are *asynchronous* (a `DialogHandler`
callback, not a return). They all share one private helper, `askEvent`: build the
message + icon + a Yes/No plate pair (or a lone acknowledge plate when the action
has no yes-key) exactly as the matching FreeCol dialog does — `MonarchDialog`,
`FirstContactDialog`, `NativeDemandDialog` — show it on the shared popup, and hand
the choice to the handler. `ClassicDialog.ask` is modal-blocking, which is right
for a demand that *must* be answered; the controllers already post these via
`invokeLater`, so blocking the EDT (which pumps events) is fine. The handler runs
in a `finally`, so a popup failure still resolves the exchange (as a reject)
rather than leaving it dangling.

The remaining two event dialogs, `showEmigrationDialog` (choose 1 of 3 recruits)
and `showNamingDialog` (name a colony/region), need the choice-list and
text-field widgets — the same Q4-blocked work as `modalChoiceDialog` /
`modalInputDialog`.

**Verified live** (2026-07-17 / -18): an end-of-turn notice (*Sons of Liberty at
10%*, title "Rundenende") and the **high-seas confirm** (title "FreeCol", ship
portrait, "Jawohl, setzt alle Segel!" / "Nein, verweilt in diesen Gewässern.")
render in the wood frame; the **error popup** (title "Fehler") renders and its
callback fires on dismiss; the **monarch tax dialog** (title "Eine Nachricht von
der Krone", per-action labels "Wir akzeptieren" / "Gebt mir Freiheit oder den
Tod!") renders and its handler fires with the mapped boolean. The error and
monarch checks were driven via a temporary key hook (reverted). 0 SEVERE
throughout. Reaching the notices needs a *populated* save — an idle unit
generates none, which is why the first attempt saw nothing.

## Seam facts (for the remaining/next work)

**`GUI` methods** (all no-ops in the base class; each Javadoc names its callers):
- View state: `changeView(Tile)` (TERRAIN), `changeView(Unit,boolean)`
  (MOVE_UNITS), `changeView()` (END_TURN), `changeView(MapTransform)`
  (map-editor only — ignore). `refresh()`/`refreshTile(Tile)`.
  `setFocus(Tile)`/`getFocus()`/`getFocusMapPoint()`/`setFocusMapPoint(Point)`.
- Model access: `getFreeColClient().getGame().getMap()`, `getMyPlayer()`; route
  clicks/keys through `getFreeColClient().getInGameController()`.

**Image lookups** (`ImageLibrary`): `getTerrainImage(TileType,x,y,size)` is the
base terrain the classic viewer draws; the pack-absent overlay fallbacks are
`getForestImage` / `getSizedOverlayImage` / `getRiverImage` (see
`ClassicTileArt`). With the pack present the feature overlays are the square
`PHYS0.SS` frames loaded by key (item (e), done — see "Feature overlays" above),
not FreeCol's isometric overlay art.

## Testing live (non-interactive harness)

The `--fast --no-intro` start-at-sea view (ship on an ocean patch, 0 SEVERE) is
the smoke test. Because this harness can't see the screen, drive/verify the
window from PowerShell: launch detached (`Start-Process -PassThru` with
redirected stdout/err — a `Start-Job` dies when the tool call ends); poll
`Get-Process -Id <pid>` for a non-zero `MainWindowHandle`; bring the window
frontmost with a minimize(6)→restore(9)→`SetForegroundWindow` bounce (a plain
`SetForegroundWindow` is refused — check `GetForegroundWindow`); drive input with
`SendKeys`/`SetCursorPos`/`mouse_event` only while frontmost; screenshot via
`CopyFromScreen` over `GetWindowRect`. Note `$pid` is a read-only automatic
variable — use another name. **Kill the game process as soon as verification is
done** (the window stealing foreground interrupts parallel work).

Hard-won details, each of which silently wastes a run:

- **`--fast` resumes the last save**, so the start state is whatever you left —
  and your test turns get autosaved back. The "starts at sea" start only happens
  on a profile with no saves.
- **The window takes ~30–55 s.** Poll `MainWindowHandle` for a couple of minutes;
  a 30 s timeout reports "no window" on a perfectly healthy launch.
- **Drive states that actually produce output.** An idle unit generates no
  notices at all. Populated saves, ending turns, `B` (found colony) and sailing
  a ship east into the high seas (fires the `highseas.text` confirm) do.
- **Screenshot a popup by the handle you enumerated**, not by re-finding it by
  title: `GetWindowText` raced against dialog creation returns a truncated title
  (a "FreeCol" dialog read as "F"), and the re-find then misses.
- **Log lives in `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Dokumente\freecol\FreeCol.log`**
  (`getUserCacheDirectory()`, OneDrive-redirected Documents) — *not* the repo root.
- In PowerShell, `Write-Output` inside a function becomes part of its **return
  value**; a logging line will silently corrupt an `if (Check ...)` boolean. Use
  `Write-Host`.
