# Classic UI (`net.sf.freecol.client.gui.classic`)

A primitive, original-1994-*Colonization*-style view for FreeCol, built as an
alternative `GUI` implementation on top of the unchanged engine. This document
is the **implementation reference** for the code in this package — the durable
"how it works / why" that outlives the phase-by-phase tracker in the repo-root
[`CLASSIC_UI_PLAN.md`](../../../../../../../CLASSIC_UI_PLAN.md) (which tracks
*remaining* work and the broader asset/rules tracks).

## What this is & how it is selected

FreeCol is cleanly layered: `common/model` (UI-agnostic game state), the
`client/control/*` controllers (reach the view only via `getGUI().<method>`),
and the view facade `client/gui/GUI.java` — a **concrete base class with no
abstract methods and no-op stubs** (used as-is in headless mode). A new UI is
therefore just another `GUI` subclass: unoverridden methods no-op, so the app
runs from day one and screens light up incrementally.

Selection point, `client/FreeColClient.java`:
```java
gui = headless ? new GUI(this) : classic ? new ClassicGUI(this) : new SwingGUI(this);
```
The `--classic` command-line flag picks `ClassicGUI`. The change to upstream is
purely additive: this package + a one-line selector change + the flag, so the
fork stays mergeable with `master`.

Run it (from the repo root, so `data/` is found):
```powershell
ant compile
java -Xmx2G -cp "build;jars/*" net.sf.freecol.FreeCol --classic --fast --no-intro
```
`--fast --no-intro` auto-starts a single-player game with no GUI clicks — the
fastest way to the in-game view. It starts at sea: the ship on an ocean patch.

## `ClassicGUI` — the view facade

`ClassicGUI extends GUI` and overrides only the methods it implements:

- **Lifecycle.** `startGUI` shows the main `JFrame` (title-screen background is
  the original `OPENING.PIK`, painted via the FreeCol key
  `image.background.MainPanel` when the `classic_original` asset pack is loaded;
  otherwise base art). `reconnectGUI(active, tile)` — the game-start hook fired
  by `FreeColClient.restoreGUI` — builds the `ClassicMapViewer`, installs it as
  the frame's whole content pane, and seeds the initial view state/focus.
  `quitGUI` disposes the frame.
- **Pre-game lobby stopgap.** There is no classic lobby yet, so
  `showStartGamePanel` auto-launches single-player games (`player.setReady(true)`
  + `requestLaunch`); otherwise a new game stalls at login because the base
  `GUI` no-ops the lobby. Multiplayer no-ops.
- **View-state delegation.** `changeView(Tile|Unit|)`, `getViewMode`,
  `getActiveUnit`, `getSelectedTile`, `getFocus`/`setFocus`,
  `refresh`/`refreshTile` all delegate to the `ClassicMapViewer`, which *owns*
  the classic view state. `refresh`/`refreshTile` also call
  `invalidateMinimap()` (they are the model-change hooks).
- **Image libraries.** `getFixedImageLibrary`/`getScaledImageLibrary` must be
  non-null even at scaffold stage: `ActionManager` builds every `FreeColAction`
  regardless of the active view and several look up order-button icons from
  their constructors. One unscaled `ImageLibrary` serves both today.
- **`showColonyPanel` stopgap (Phase 2 seam).** A click on an owned colony
  hosts FreeCol's own `ColonyPanel` in a standalone `JFrame` (the classic UI has
  no `Canvas`), guarded so any failure just logs. Never reached at start-at-sea.
  Phase 2 replaces this with a real classic colony screen.

## `ClassicMapViewer` — the map

A `JPanel` that renders the map on a **plain rectangular grid** (where
`SwingGUI`'s `MapViewer` paints isometric diamonds) centred on a focus tile,
mirroring the original game. It owns the view state
(`viewMode`/`focus`/`selectedTile`/`activeUnit`) and holds a back-reference to
`ClassicGUI` so clicks/keys route through the `GUI`/controller path exactly as
`SwingGUI.clickAt`/`MoveAction` do.

**Projection** (square 48px cells = native 16px × `CLASSIC_SCALE` 3):
```
screenX = width/2  + (tileX - focusX) * TILE_W - TILE_W/2
screenY = height/2 + (tileY - focusY) * TILE_H - TILE_H/2
```
`tileAt(px,py)` is the inverse (via `Math.floorDiv`).

**Terrain rendering.** The original rectangular `TERRAIN.SS` tiles fill the grid
cleanly (no diamond gaps). Tiles are fetched at native 16×16 via
`ImageLibrary.getTerrainImage(type, x, y, SRC_SIZE)` and up-scaled
nearest-neighbour (`VALUE_INTERPOLATION_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR`) so the chunky classic
pixels stay crisp; oversized FreeCol unit/settlement art is shrunk to fit the
cell by `drawCentered`. Unexplored tiles are left black (classic fog). The
key→frame mapping lives in `tools/classic_assets/aliases.properties`. When the
asset pack is absent the same keys fall back to FreeCol's own (isometric) art.

**Edge scrolling.** A mouse-motion listener sets an edge direction when the
cursor enters a ~1-tile hot zone at any window edge/corner; a repeating `Timer`
pans the focus by a **raw** rectangular-grid step while the mouse stays there
(stopped on `mouseExited`). Raw `(x,y)` steps, *not* `Direction.step` — the
isometric N/S step jumps two raw rows. Suppressed while the mouse is over the
minimap box.

**Controller wiring (clicks & keys drive the real `InGameController`).**

- **Click** ports `SwingGUI.clickAt`: unexplored → `setFocus`; owned colony →
  `showColonyPanel`; owned unit → `changeView(unit,false)` (make active);
  foreign unit/settlement → `setFocus`; empty explored tile → `changeView(tile)`
  (TERRAIN-select). A single click already terrain-selects (the rectangular grid
  has no drag-vs-click ambiguity), which also arms the TERRAIN cursor keys.
  Minimap-region clicks are intercepted *before* this (see below).
- **Keys** mirror `MoveAction`: arrow / numpad 8-2-4-6 orthogonal, numpad
  7-9-1-3 & Home/PageUp/End/PageDown diagonal, bound `WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW`.
  MOVE_UNITS → `InGameController.moveUnit(activeUnit, dir)`; TERRAIN → step the
  selected-tile cursor to `getNeighbourOrNull(dir)`; nothing selected (END_TURN)
  → raw-grid free pan so the map stays navigable. After a unit move the focus
  follows the unit.
- **⚠️ Isometric-vs-rectangular caveat (resolved).** Model `Direction` is
  isometric (`Direction.N` steps two raw rows), but this viewer draws a raw grid.
  The four orthogonal keys therefore resolve — parity-aware, via
  `Map.getDirection` — to the `Direction` whose *raw* step lands on the visually
  adjacent cell (e.g. straight-up is `NE` on even rows, `NW` on odd), so
  on-screen movement matches the key. The four diagonal keys map to the
  isometric corner directions, whose raw offset shifts with row parity — an
  inherent flattening artefact, documented on `intentToDirection`.
- **Not wired:** FreeCol's `moveAction`/`endTurn` accelerators (no menu bar /
  `Canvas` installs them yet), so e.g. Enter does not end the turn. A unit that
  exhausts its moves simply stops. Expected until Phase 2 adds the HUD.

**Minimap overlay.** A whole-map overview in the bottom-left, painted at the end
of `paintComponent` (after map + cursor). It is a plain rectangular
`map.getWidth() × map.getHeight()` raster — **no** isometric projection (unlike
`client/gui/panel/MiniMap`, which is the colour-source reference only):

- Colours: unexplored → `ImageLibrary.getMinimapBackgroundColor()`; explored →
  `getMinimapPoliticsColor(tile.getType())`; a tile with a settlement/unit →
  the owner's `getNationColor()`; frame + viewport box →
  `getMinimapBorderColor()`. All guarded with fallbacks (`orElse`).
- Sizing: integer pixels-per-tile `max(1, MINIMAP_MAX/max(w,h))` fits the raster
  into a ~200px box, so a tall/narrow map renders as a vertical strip.
- **Caching / performance:** the raster is cached in a `BufferedImage` and
  rebuilt only when `invalidateMinimap()` marks it dirty — wired to
  `ClassicGUI.refresh`/`refreshTile`, the model-change hooks (exploration, new
  settlements, unit moves). Ordinary pan/cursor repaints just blit the cache +
  overlay the viewport box, so no per-repaint tile iteration on large maps.
- **Viewport box:** a rectangle marking the tile region visible in the main view
  (focus ± half the `TILE_W`/`TILE_H` span), clipped to the box.
- **Click-to-recentre:** minimap-region clicks are intercepted in `onClick`
  *before* `tileAt`, translated to a tile via the pixels-per-tile scale, and
  `setFocus`ed, so a minimap click never also selects terrain underneath.

## Seam facts (for the remaining/next work)

**`GUI` methods** (all no-ops in the base class; each Javadoc names its callers):
- View state: `changeView(Tile)` (TERRAIN), `changeView(Unit,boolean)`
  (MOVE_UNITS), `changeView()` (END_TURN), `changeView(MapTransform)`
  (map-editor only — ignore). `refresh()`/`refreshTile(Tile)`.
  `setFocus(Tile)`/`getFocus()`/`getFocusMapPoint()`/`setFocusMapPoint(Point)`.
- Model access: `getFreeColClient().getGame().getMap()`, `getMyPlayer()`; route
  clicks/keys through `getFreeColClient().getInGameController()`.

**Image lookups** (`ImageLibrary`) for per-tile compositing beyond the base
`.center` tile (Phase 1 item (e), still to do): `getTerrainImage(TileType,x,y,
size)` (what we draw now), `getTileImageWithOverlayAndForest(...)`, plus
overlay/forest/river/road `get…Image` helpers. `client/gui/mapviewer/` is the
reference for the *selection* logic; keep that, but use the rectangular
projection above instead of its isometric `TileBounds`/`MapViewerBounds`.

## Testing live (non-interactive harness)

The `--fast --no-intro` start-at-sea view (ship on an ocean patch, 0 SEVERE) is
the smoke test. Because this harness can't see the screen, drive/verify the
window from PowerShell: launch detached (`Start-Process -PassThru` with
redirected stdout/err — a `Start-Job` dies when the tool call ends); poll
`Get-Process -Id <pid>` for a non-zero `MainWindowHandle`; bring the window
frontmost with a minimize(6)→restore(9)→`SetForegroundWindow` bounce (a plain
`SetForegroundWindow` is refused — check `GetForegroundWindow`); drive input with
`SendKeys`/`SetCursorPos`/`mouse_event` only while frontmost; screenshot via
`CopyFromScreen` over `GetWindowRect`. Note `$pid` is a read-only automatic
variable — use another name. **Kill the game process as soon as verification is
done** (the window stealing foreground interrupts parallel work).
